<p>The warder of the Tower has his bout with
the citizen on the green; Sir Walter Raleigh
looks on from above, and the lieutenant’s
wife from below and neither of the
three—warder, lieutenant’s wife, nor the
prisoner, Sir Walter—can agree with either
of the other two as to what took place. Inside
the Tower three different tales are told. It is
reasonably certain that still another version
was given when the citizen got back to town
and began to talk.</p>

<p>How, then, can any one expect to learn
exactly what occurred on Sunday, June 18th,
1815, in front of the village of Mont-Saint-Jean?
Many witnesses testify, and the conflict
of testimony is utterly irreconcilable.
Much of the battle was not seen by Napoleon,
and much of it was hidden from Wellington.
Every officer who took part in it and who afterward
wrote about it contributed something
to the story, but what officer could tell
it all?</p>

<p>From the day after the battle down to the
present time, men and women have studied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
the field itself, have pored over dispatches,
have devoured Memoirs, have eagerly listened
to the slightest word which anybody
who was in possession of a fact had to say
about Waterloo: yet a mystery hangs over
the entire campaign.</p>

<p>Did Wellington really believe that he
fought D’Erlon’s corps at Quatre Bras? He
says so, positively, in his official report of the
action. Yet we <em>know</em> that D’Erlon’s corps
did not come even within striking distance,
at any time during the day. Full of inaccuracies
as his account of the battle is, the
Duke would never correct the statement; nor
could he ever be persuaded to give any other.
In fact, whenever the subject was mentioned
he grew testy; and curtly referred the questioner
to his official report.</p>

<p>On the Prussian side, there was a current
of intense feeling against Wellington; but
there were such powerful motives for silence
that the truth crept out slowly, and at long
intervals. At first, Waterloo was claimed to
be an English victory. Wellington led the
way in this by his slighting reference to “the
flank movement of Bülow.” No one would
gather from the Duke’s report that 16,000
of the French troops, during the afternoon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
of the 18th, had been fighting desperately,
for several hours to hold the Prussians
in check. No one could possibly learn
from this report the fact that the French did
not give way on the English front until the
cannon balls of the oncoming Prussians of
Zeiten’s corps were crossing those of the English
batteries which swept the approaches to
Mont-Saint-Jean. Reading Wellington’s official
report of the battle, one would believe
that the Prussians arrived after the fight was
won—that they had nothing to do but chase
the defeated. Only by degrees did the world
learn that Wellington entirely disregarded
the pledge he had given Blücher at the conference
in May; that he wrote Blücher a letter
on the morning of June 16th that was full
of deception; left his troops widely scattered
when the enemy was upon him; gave
orders which his lieutenants had the nerve
and the wisdom to violate, and was saved
from annihilation at the very opening of
the campaign by the incredible mistakes
of Napoleon’s officers and the heroic gallantry
of the Prussians. Lord Wolseley
complacently states that Wellington was
an English gentleman of the highest type
and, therefore, incapable of falsehood. Yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
the Duke’s official report states that on
the 15th he ordered the concentration of his
army at Quatre Bras; <em>and Lord Wolseley
demonstrates that the statement was untrue</em>.
It was on Nivelles that a partial concentration
was ordered, and had the orders been
obeyed the campaign would have been
wrecked.</p>

<p>Only of late years has it been perfectly
clear that at half-past one o’clock in the afternoon
of June 18th Napoleon had to divide
his army, and to withhold the corps of
Lobau which had been ordered to support the
great charge of D’Erlon and Ney. Suppose
this corps of fresh men had been thrown
against the English line when it had already
been well-nigh broken. At the time the premature
cavalry charges were being made, and
the English, in squares, were suffering so terribly
from the French skirmishers and artillery,
suppose 16,000 men whom Napoleon
had sent to drive the Prussians back from
Plancenoit, where they threatened his rear,
had been in hand to clinch the cavalry
charges! How could the English have prevented
these fresh troops from pouring
through the gap in their line behind La Haye-Sainte?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>Only of late years has it been generally
known that it was the arrival of Zeiten’s
Prussians on his left that released the troops
with which Wellington filled this break in
his line.</p>

<p>It was only when the Prussians of Zeiten’s
corps, breaking through to the right of the
French who were attacking the English and
to the left of the French who were withstanding
Blücher, came thundering on their flank
that the French army cried “<em>Treachery!
Treachery!</em>” and dissolved in universal dismay.</p>

<p>As to Napoleon, whenever he talked of
Waterloo he either confined himself to despairing
ejaculations or involved himself in
contradictions. He blamed himself for not
having reconnoitered Wellington’s position;
he admitted that he had not had a good view
of the field; he confessed that he had made
a mistake in changing his plan of assailing the
English right; he denied giving the order for
the heavy cavalry to charge, although this
order had been carried by his own aide-decamp,
Count Flahaut—the father of one or
two of Hortense’s queerly mixed brood of
children; and he severely blamed D’Erlon,
Ney and Grouchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>A curious evidence of the difficulty of learning
the truth about Waterloo is to be found in
Victor Hugo’s “Les Miserables.” Describing
the struggle for Hougoumont, he speaks
of the fight in the chapel. He represents the
sacred building as having gone through all
the horrors of war, having been splashed with
blood, having been torn by shot and shell, and
having been ravaged by fire. All this seems
probable enough, and yet the English authoress
of “Waterloo Days” visited the battlefield
a few hours after the fight and
she makes particular mention of this same
chapel; and she declares that it “stood uninjured”!
Listen to this lady—Charlotte
Eaton: “No shot or shell had penetrated its
sacred walls; and no sacrilegious hand had
dared to violate its humble altar, which was
still adorned with its ancient ornaments and
its customary care.” This is quite different
from Hugo’s “Soldiers massacred each other
in the chapel.”</p>

<p>After Hugo’s famous description of Waterloo
appeared, all the world talked of “the
old road of Ohain” which had, the novelist
declared, been the pitfall and the tomb of
the French cavalry. Painters caught up the
theme, and the legend lives on imperishable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
canvas. But now history discards the story.
The road from Ohain to Braine l’Alleud
<em>does</em> become a hollow way, between steep
banks, for about 400 yards; but the French
were aware of the fact, and the cavalry did
<em>not</em> charge across the trench. The charges
passed over the road where it was on a level
with the plain. It <em>is</em> true, however, that in
the bewildering movements incident to charge
and countercharge, a small body of French
cavalry came upon this “hollow way,”
walked their horses down the bank, got upon
the road, and were about to ride up the other
bank to get at the English, when the English
cavalry charged the road, making it impossible
for the French to mount the bank. They
then rode up “the hollow way,”—hacked at
by the English above,—until they reached the
level ground, when they retired into the open
field to reform.</p>

<p>There has been much controversy as to
whether the Duke of Wellington rode over
to Blücher’s camp on the night of the 17th.
There is now conclusive evidence that no such
visit was made.</p>

<p>In Archibald Forbes’s “Camps, Quarters
and Casual Places,” published in 1896, we
find: “Quite recently there have been found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
and are now in the possession of the Rev.
Frederick Gurney, the grandson of the late
Sir John Gurney, the notes of a ‘conversation
with the Duke of Wellington and Baron Gurney
and Mr. Justice Williams, Judges on Circuit,
at Strathfieldsaye House, on 24th February,
1837.’ The annotator was Baron
Gurney, to the following effect: ‘The conversation
had been commenced by my inquiring
of him (the Duke) whether a story
which I had heard was true of his having
ridden over to Blücher on the night before
the battle of Waterloo, and returned on the
same horse. He said, “No, that was not so.
I did not see Blücher on the day before Waterloo.
I saw him the day before, on the day
of Quatre Bras. I saw him after Waterloo,
and he kissed me. He embraced me on horseback.
I had communicated with him the day
before Waterloo.” The rest of the conversation
made no further reference to the topic
of the ride to Wavre.’”</p>

<p>In Houssaye’s “1815” the statement is
made that the French troops did not receive
their rations on the night of the 17th until
after midnight, or even later.</p>

<p>The truth seems to be that some of the
troops got nothing at all to eat. They went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
into the fight on empty stomachs—stimulated
by a drink of brandy. The enemy, of course,
suffered no such disadvantage, for ample
supplies came from Brussels. Again, the
English had camp-fires to keep themselves
warm and to dry their clothing; the French
had no fires, and went into action chilled, and
in wet clothing.</p>

<p>To understand the physical disadvantage
against which the French had to struggle, we
should remember that they had to charge <em>up
hill over miry ground</em>. The English were
stationary on the crest, excepting when they
charged, and <em>then</em> they charged <em>down hill</em>.
Those who have walked over a ploughed
field, or who have galloped a horse up a miry
slope, will know how to appreciate the immense
difficulties under which the French labored.</p>

<p>In 1815 the Emperor was no longer a
lean, sinewy, tireless, eternally vigilant human
tiger—the Napoleon of Rivoli and
Marengo. He was no longer the consummate
General-in-Chief of Austerlitz and Wagram.
The mysterious lethargy which had
overwhelmed him at the critical hour of Borodino,
when he withheld the order for the
Old Guard to charge and convert the Russian
defeat into a decisive disaster, had been the
first visit of the Evil Genius which was to
come again. The strange loss of <em>the power
to decide</em> between two totally different lines
of action, which, at the Château Düben had
kept him idle two days, lolling on a sofa, or
sitting at his writing-table tracing on the paper
big school-boy letters, was to become a
recurrent calamity, puzzling all who knew
him, and paralyzing the action of his lieutenants
in the most critical emergencies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>At Leipsic the reins had fallen from his
hands; only one permanent bridge over the
deep river in his rear had been provided to let
him out of the death trap; and when the
strong currents of the rout tore through the
frantic city, the great Napoleon drifted with
the furious tide, whistling vacantly.</p>

<p>The same unexplainable <em>eclipse of genius</em>,
which General E.&nbsp;P. Alexander described as
occurring to Stonewall Jackson, in the Malvern
Hill movements of our Civil War,
happened to the French Emperor, time and
again, after that first collapse at Borodino.</p>

<p>In Spain he ordered a madly reckless
charge of his Polish Light Cavalry against
the heights of Sommo Sierra, where the
Spanish army was entrenched and where the
position easily admitted of successful flanking,
got his best troops wastefully butchered—and
could not afterward remember who gave
the order to charge!</p>

<p>In Dresden, in 1813, he had won a brilliant
victory which needed only to be ruthlessly
pushed; and he was pushing it with all his
tremendous driving power when, in the twinkle
of an eye, his Evil Genius descended upon
him, took his strength away, held him in invisible
but inexorable bonds;—and when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
spell passed, the fruits of the glorious triumph
were all gone, and Despair had thrown its
baleful shadow athwart every possible line of
action.</p>

<p>The mighty Emperor, in years gone by,
had overdrawn his account at the bank of
Nature, and his drafts were now coming back
on him, protested. He who had once slept
too little, now slept too much. Often in the
earlier campaigns he had abstained from eating;
now he over-ate. The reckless exposures
and the intensely sustained labor of sixteen
hours out of the twenty-four were taking
their revenge. The corpulent Napoleon now
loved his ease, was soon fatigued, spent hours
in the tepid bath, and slept away the early
morning when every advance of the sunbeam
meant lost ground to the eagles of France.</p>

<p>Talkative, when he had once been reticent;
undecided, where he had been resolute; careless,
where he had been indefatigable and
cautious; despondent, where he had been
serenely confident, the Emperor who had
sprung with hawk-like determination upon the
plotting Bourbons, had clutched their unsuspecting
Duc D’Enghien, dragged him to
Paris in the night, shot him, and buried him
in a ditch before day—this Emperor did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
not have enough of that terrific energy left
to even fling the traitors, Fouché and Talleyrand,
into prison.</p>

<p>He knew that these two men were at their
old tricks again, but he could not act. Looking
at Fouché calmly, Napoleon said, “I
ought to have you shot.” Nothing could
prove more conclusively that the Napoleon of
old no longer lived. Had he been the man
of Brumaire, or Lodi, or Jena, he would have
shot the traitor first, and talked about it afterward.</p>

<p>In the sere and yellow leaf of life, but still
Titanic in his proportions, the Emperor, once
the charity-boy of Brienne,—he who fought
the whole school when the young aristocrats
of France made fun of his shabby clothes and
Corsican birth,—<em>stood at bay against a world
in arms</em>.</p>

<p>Feudalism against him: Caste against
him: Hereditary Aristocracy against him:
The Divine Right of Kings against him; and
above all, the ignorance, the prejudice, and
<em>the unwillingness of mankind to be forced out
of old ruts</em> were against him. Against him
was a Church hierarchy which panted for
ancient powers and immunities and wealth.
Against him were the Privileged Few of every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
government on earth—<em>those who feast on
Class legislation and resent interruption</em>.
Against him were all those who denied the
right of a nation to choose its own ruler, those
who hated the dogma that the true foundation
to government is the consent of the governed.
To meet so powerful a combination, the <em>one</em>
sure resource was that from which Napoleon
shrank in horror—an appeal to the Jacobins,
the Sansculottes, the fierce men of the masses
who hated the priest and the aristocrat.</p>

<p>“<em>When one has had misfortunes one no
longer has the confidence which is necessary
to success.</em>”</p>

<p>With this mournful remark, made in private
to that noble old Revolutionary patriot,
Carnot, the Emperor made ready to leave
Paris to join his army.</p>

<p>In gathering up the scattered remnants of
his former hosts Napoleon had worked at a
vast disadvantage. Time and money were
what he needed most. He had not enough
of either.</p>

<p>His escape from Elba had found the Congress
of Vienna still in session. The Kings
who had pulled him off his throne, in 1814,
were all in Vienna, together. The armies
which had outnumbered him and crushed him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
were still in battle array. The traitors who
had plotted his overthrow, the traitors who
had deserted him on the field of battle—the
Talleyrands, on the one hand, and the Marmonts
on the other—were all in lusty life,
ready to make sure of their guilty heads by
bringing the wounded colossus down.</p>

<p>In the midst of the splendid festivities in
Vienna; in the midst of the pomps and
parades, the jubilations over the fall of the
one Throned Democrat of the world; in the
midst of the congratulations, the gayeties, the
feasting and dancing, the illuminations and
the joyous music, there comes the clap of
thunder from the clear sky.</p>

<p><em>Napoleon has left Elba!</em></p>

<p>In Dumas’s story, “Twenty Years After,”
do you remember that thrilling chapter in
which the news is brought to the immortal
Three that their deadly foe, Mordaunt, <em>whom
they supposed they had killed</em>, is alive? Do
you remember how Athos, the loftiest man of
the Three, rose <em>and took down his sword</em>,
which he had momentarily hung upon the
wall, <em>gravely buckling it around him</em>? A
desperate man is on his track; his sword must
be at his hand.</p>

<p>So it was with the European Kings, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Vienna. They had banded themselves together
to break the scepter of the Crowned
Democrat whose Civil Code, with its glorious
maxims, all tending to <em>Justice</em> and to <em>Equality
before the law</em>, was a deadly menace to the
existence of <em>Divine Right</em> and <em>Special Privilege</em>.
They had deceived their own peoples
with lies about Napoleon, and with promises
of reforms which they never meant to
keep; they had deluged France with a flood
of foreign invasion that swept all before
it; they had bought the Fouchés and
Talleyrands; they had seduced the Murats
and Bernadottes and Moreaus and Marmonts;
they had captured Napoleon’s wife
and child, and had deafened their ears
and hardened their hearts to the appeals
of the husband and father. They had
stricken the sword out of his hand, the
crown off his head. They thought that they
had made an end of this “Disturber of the
Public Peace”—this enthroned Democrat,
whose levelling watchword of “<em>All careers
open to talent</em>,” they hated as a tyrant hates
a rebel, as <em>despotism hates liberty</em>. And now
<em>Napoleon was in France again.</em> No wonder
that consternation seized Vienna.</p>

<p>“<em>Look to yourself; the lion is loose!</em>” was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
the warning cry which a King of France had
sounded in the ears of a false and affrighted
King of England, ages before. If Richard
Coeur de Lion’s escape from the Castle of
Dürrenstein turned to water the blood of
Philip and John, the sensation in Europe was
as nothing compared to that created by
Napoleon’s escape from Elba.</p>

<p><em>Back to France!</em> In those three words
burns the purpose of the European Kings.
The Russian army is far advanced on its
homeward march, but it must be halted; the
tired feet of the soldiers must not rest an hour.
<em>Back to France!</em> The Austrian legions are
at home, ready to enjoy the well-earned rest.
Must the bugles call once more?—once more
the streets and the lanes thrill at the beat of
the drums? <em>Back to France!</em> The Prussian
and the British armies have not had time to
start home. They are in cantonments, in the
Low Countries, close to the frontier of
France. Old Blücher—“<em>that drunken hussar
who has given me as much trouble as anybody</em>,”
as Napoleon used to say—is already
in the saddle, with a splendid staff which plans
his campaigns for him.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington, the hero of the
Congress of Vienna, must now hasten to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Brussels to take command of his army. All
the world believes that Napoleon will force
the fighting, and that he will strike the enemy
nearest him, there on the Belgian frontier.</p>

<p>Thus, in 1815, as the month of June lavishes
its splendors on the earth, the eyes of all
Christendom are fastened upon Napoleon
Bonaparte. It is hardly too much to say that
the world stands still, this fateful month, to
watch the unequal fight—Napoleon against
the Kings!</p>

<p>How hard it is to understand the delusion
under which some of the best men of the
time labored! With eyes to see, why were
they so blind? With ears to hear, why were
they so deaf?</p>

<p>Grattan!—why did <em>your</em> electric oratory
smite with its lightnings this great enemy
of tyranny, when Ireland, <em>your own home</em>,
was bleeding under the remorseless cruelty of
the very system which Napoleon had struggled
to tear down? La Fayette!—why were
<em>you</em> throwing stumbling blocks in this big
man’s way, fettering him with shackles and
cords, when your French Samson needed the
uttermost length of his locks?</p>

<p>Why was it that every Liberal in Europe
could not realize as Carnot did,—he of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
Great Committee which piloted France
through the storm of the Revolution!—that
in Napoleon’s fate, <em>at that time</em>, was bound
up the best interests of the human race?</p>

<p>Behind the confederated Kings <em>lurked the
Ancient Régime</em>. It panted for life. It
wanted to re-establish the blessed order of
things in which the Few, booted and spurred,
put into governmental form their modest
claim to the privilege of riding the Many.
It wanted to stamp out the revolutionary
principles which had been <em>lifting the masses</em>,
and lowering the monstrous pretensions of the
classes.</p>

<p>Had not Metternich declared, “There can
be no peace with such principles”? Had not
the restored Bourbons of 1814 proved to an
astonished world that they had learned nothing,
and forgotten nothing? Had they not
set about annihilating the glorious work of
reform which had cost France so much—so
much in consecrated toil, so much in well-spent
treasure, so much in patriotic sacrifice, so
much in heroic blood? Had they not done
their level best, in 1814, to blow the trump of
resurrection for every abuse, every wrong
which France had buried amid the rejoicings
of the Progressives all over the world?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>What was the “Revolution of July, 1848,”
but the final triumph of Napoleon Bonaparte?
<em>It was that and nothing more.</em> Had France
been true to herself in 1815 there would have
been no Bourbon Charles the Tenth; there
would have been no Bourbon Louis Philippe;
there would have been no occasion for the
long postponement of the supremacy of the
Revolutionary Principles.</p>

<p>“<em>With such principles there can be no
peace</em>,” said Metternich, the favorite minister
of the Confederated Kings; and what La Fayette
ought to have known, and Grattan ought
to have known, and the Progressives everywhere
ought to have known, was that <em>the war
of the allied Kings was against those democratic
principles</em>.</p>

<p>Had Napoleon been willing to be <em>just a
king as they were</em>, there would have been for
him no Waterloo.</p>

<p>“<em>Emperor, Consul, Soldier!</em>—I owe everything
<em>to the people</em>!”—declared Napoleon,
throwing down the gauntlet of duel-to-the-death
at the feet of Legitimacy, Divine Right
and Absolutism.</p>

<p>No wonder the crafty Metternich, who
guided the policies of hereditary kings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
snatched up the glove and said, “<em>With such
principles there can be no peace.</em>”</p>

<p>In America the masses of the people sympathized
with the French Emperor, and hoped
that he would win. At the Hermitage, in
Tennessee, the dauntless warrior who had recently
whipped the flower of Wellington’s
army at New Orleans, ardently hoped that
Napoleon would win.</p>

<p>In Great Britain tens of thousands of the
followers of Fox hoped that the right of the
French to select their own rulers would be
vindicated. Throughout Continental Europe
a powerful minority yearned for the system of
the Code Napoleon, and secretly prayed for
the great Law-giver’s success.</p>

<p>Byron’s friend, Hobhouse, wrote June 12,
1815: “Regarding Napoleon and his warriors
as the partisans of the cause of peoples
against the Conspiracy of Kings, I cannot
help wishing that the French may meet with
as much success as will not compromise the
military character of my own countrymen.
As an Englishman, I will not be a witness of
their triumphs; as a lover of liberty, I would
not be a spectator of their reverses. I leave
Paris to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Wherever men understood the tremendous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
issues that were about to be fought out; wherever
there was an intelligent comprehension
of the consequences that were inevitably connected
with the triumph of the Allied Kings,
there was intense longing for the triumph of
the French.</p>

<p>The French masses eagerly besought the
Emperor to give them arms—but he shrank
from the menace of Communism, even as he
had done when he refused to arm the Russian
serf against his lord.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In the hours of trial, three of Napoleon’s
brothers had drawn to him again. They had
been much to blame for his downfall. Joseph
had abandoned Paris in 1814, when there was
no urgent necessity for it, and when Napoleon
was flying toward it, on horseback, at headlong
speed. Lucien had been wrong-headed,
turbulent, making trouble at Rome and elsewhere.
Jerome’s management in Westphalia
had incensed and disgusted Germany. As to
Louis, the fourth brother, that impossible
dolt and ingrate did not show his face, but retired
into Switzerland. He was the younger
brother with whom Napoleon had shared his
slender pay when lieutenant, and who had
lived with the elder brother and been taught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
by him, and in every way treated by him as a
father treats a son.</p>

<p>As to Madame Mère, the heroic old
mother, she had refused to come to Paris to
take part in the gorgeous ceremonial of Napoleon’s
Coronation; she stayed away, at Rome,
where Lucien Bonaparte, in temporary disgrace,
drew the maternal sympathy to the less
fortunate son. No, she would not go to
Napoleon in 1800, when all Europe was at
his feet, and he was the King of Kings. She
stayed at Rome with Lucien. But when the
awful reverses came, when the scepters were
broken in the hands of the Bonapartes, when
Napoleon was prostrate and outlawed,
Madame Letitia,—Madame Mère,—remembered
only that he was her son. Josephine,
frail at first, but at last loyal and loving, could
not go to Elba; she was dead. Maria
Louise, the Austrian wife, frail as well as
false, would not go to Elba; she had already
turned her lewd eyes toward the gallant Neipperg.
But Madame Mère could go to Elba,
and she went. And when Napoleon left for
France, she soon followed. So, she is with
him now, heart and soul. For the day is dark
and dreary. The somber clouds hang low.
Thunder rolls in the distance—rolls with sullen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
menace and ominous reverberation. And
because the whole world is against her son,
Madame Mère turns from the whole world
<em>to him</em>! Heroic old woman! From her
adamantine character was drawn the strength
which laid Europe at Napoleon’s feet.</p>

<p>In the “Barrington Sketches” is drawn a
vivid picture of the last public occasion on
which appeared together the most remarkable
mother and son that ever lived. It was on
the 8th of June, four days before Napoleon
left Paris to join his army.</p>

<p>The dignitaries of the Empire were assembled
in the Chamber of Deputies to take the
oath of allegiance to the Emperor. It was a
magnificent ceremonial. In the streets, on the
quays and in the parks were great throngs of
people, and among the military the enthusiasm
was unbounded. No longer crying “<i lang="fr">Vive
l’Empereur</i>,” their shouts rolled in thunder
tones, “<i lang="fr">Empereur! Empereur!</i>” The roar
of cannon shook the earth, and the air thrilled
with the music of the bands. In the great
and splendid Chamber of Deputies were assembled
a brilliant array of the nobility of
France—those who had been born great,
those who had achieved greatness, and those
who had had greatness thrust upon them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
They had assembled to swear loyalty to their
Emperor, Napoleon—and not one of those
who were present knew better the frailty of
such a bond of allegiance than the Emperor
himself. And when Fouché took the oath,
Napoleon turned his head and looked fixedly,
calmly at the traitor. Sir Jonah Barrington
says that Fouché faltered and flushed. But
I doubt it. Sir Jonah Barrington says that
he watched Napoleon’s countenance, intently
studying its every detail. He says that the
Emperor sat unmoved, his face somewhat
shaded by the ostrich plumes of his black
Spanish hat, the size of his bust concealed by
“the short cloak of purple velvet, embroidered
with golden bees.” Sir Jonah speaks of
the “high and ungraceful shoulders,” and declares
that he was “by no means a majestic
figure.” “I watched his eye. It was that of
a hawk.” He then describes how this brilliant
glance swept from one face to another,
throughout the assemblage, without a movement
of the Emperor’s head.</p>

<p>Sir Jonah describes Napoleon’s mother as
“a very fine old lady, apparently about sixty,
but looking strong and in good health, well
looking, and possessing a cheerful, <em>comfortable</em>
countenance. In short, I liked her appearance;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
it was plain and unassuming.”
Then Sir Jonah tells how he settled down to
study her expression to learn her sensations
during the splendid ceremonial. And after
the most critical attention to the varying expressions
of the “comfortable countenance” of
this fine old lady, Sir Jonah reaches the conclusion
that the emotions which move her as
the brilliant function progresses, are just those
<em>of a mother proud of her son</em>!</p>

<p>“I could perceive no lofty sensations of
gratified ambition, no towering pride, no vain
and empty arrogance, as she viewed underneath
her the peers and representatives of her
son’s dominions.”</p>

<p>What emotion was it, then, that filled her
bosom on that last great day in Paris? “A
tear occasionally moistened her cheek, but it
evidently proceeded from a happy rather than
a painful feeling—it was the tear of parental
ecstasy.”</p>

<p>After Napoleon had been caged at St.
Helena, and was being denied comforts that
had become necessary to him, his mother
was one of those who supplied the captive
with funds. Some one remonstrated with
her, telling her that she would reduce herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
to poverty, and that she would be destitute in
her old age. The heroic old Corsican answered,
“What does it matter? When I
shall have nothing more, I will take my stick
and go about <em>begging alms for Napoleon’s
mother</em>.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p>It was half-past three on the morning of
June 12th when Napoleon entered his carriage
and set out for the Belgian frontier.
On the 13th he was at Avesnes, on the 14th at
Beaumont. One who was near the imperial
carriage, on its rapid course from Paris, states
that the Emperor was often asleep during the
day; and that he declared that he was utterly
worn out by his three months’ toil. Little
wonder. A man who had gone through the
tremendous ordeal which Napoleon had
passed since his return from Elba—an ordeal
which taxed soul, mind, and body—was fortunate
in being left with any strength at all.
His actual hours of labor had been an average
of fifteen per day, to say nothing of the anxieties,
the discouragements, and the humiliations
which made such enormous demands upon his
fortitude, his patience, his tact, his powers of
self-control.</p>

<p>Asked at St. Helena what had been the
happiest period of his life, Napoleon
answered, “The progress from Cannes to
Paris.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>But however elated he may have been during
that bloodless re-conquest of an empire,
the illusion that all France rejoiced in his return
soon passed away. The indifference of
Paris chilled him. The absence of many a
companion-in-arms who had fought under his
eagles was depressing. The knowledge that
he would have to accept fettering conditions,
and the services of men who denounced him
the year before, mortified him. To Count
Molé he declared that had he known how
many concessions he would have to make, he
would never have left Elba.</p>

<p>These were concessions to those who were
called Republicans, and who were dreaming
of popular self-government—for which Napoleon
did not believe that France was prepared.
Having become an Emperor, he was
naturally opposed to a republic. Besides, a
man of his vast superiority over other men
naturally believes that he can achieve the best
results when given a free hand. With pathetic
earnestness he had appealed to the Legislative
to help him save France from her
enemies, reminding them of the decadent
Roman senate which had wrangled over vain
abstractions while the battering-rams of the
barbarians thundered against the walls. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
no purpose. Until his power had been fully
re-established by victory over the Allies, the
Legislative would remain factious and obstructive;
should the Allies triumph, the Legislative
would be ready to renounce him, as
in 1814.</p>

<p>And where were his old comrades? Where
were those who had grown famous under his
flag, made great by his lessons, rich and powerful
by his munificence?</p>

<p>Lannes had fallen, during the awful days
of Wagram. Duroc had been disembowelled
by a cannon ball, in one of the bloody struggles
of 1813. Junot had killed himself in a
fit of madness. LaSalle had thrown away his
life, on the Danube, in a needless cavalry
charge. The gallant Poniatowski, of the
royal house of Poland, had gone to a watery
grave in the Elster, after the Titanic struggle
at Leipsic. Bessières, Commander of the Old
Guard, who had led the great cavalry charges
at Eckmuhl and at Wagram, had met a
soldier’s death, at the head of his men, at the
battle of Lutzen. Oudinot had shown incapacity
during 1814, and Napoleon would
have no more to do with him. Souham had
acted the traitor; and when he came to seek
command again, Napoleon said, “What do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
you want of me? Can’t you see that I do not
know you any more?” Masséna renewed his
allegiance to the Emperor, and sought military
command; but he was too old and feeble
for active service, and Napoleon disappointed
his hopes of getting the 9th division. Suchet
was put in command of the Army of the Alps.
Jourdan was made Governor of Besancon.
Brune also renewed his allegiance—an act
for which the White Terror was to inflict
upon him a horrible penalty. Gouvion Saint-Cyr
had disobeyed Napoleon’s orders in 1814,
and had commanded his troops to resume the
white cockade, after the 20th of March, when
the Chamber voted Napoleon’s deposition.
The Emperor now exiled him to his castle.
Sérurier and the elder Kellerman had voted
for deposition, but Napoleon punished neither.
Marshall Moncey would have been willing
to take command again under the Emperor,
but, as he had published a violent order of
the day against Napoleon in 1814, he was not
given a military appointment, but, like Lefebre,
he was raised to the Chamber of Peers.
Bernadotte sat firmly on the throne of Sweden,
ready to renew the fight against his countrymen,
to insure the reward of his treachery—Norway.
Marmont, in mortal terror of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
vengeance which his base betrayal of Paris deserved,
had fled with the Bourbons across the
Rhine. Augereau had offered his services,
but he was no longer the Augereau of Castiglione,
and the Emperor could not overlook
the personal insult to which the recreant Marshal
had subjected him on the high-road,
while on his way to Elba. Macdonald, who
had led the great charge against the Austrian
center at Wagram, had taken service under
the Bourbons, and refused to serve Napoleon
again. Mortier was ready for the final campaign
and joined the army, but, falling sick,
sold his chargers to Ney and took no part in
the fighting of the Hundred Days. Berthier,
the favorite of his chief, the bosom friend, the
constant companion; Berthier, of whom Napoleon
was so fond that he petted him like a
spoilt child and would not dine in his tent until
Berthier came to share the meal—Berthier
had put on the King’s uniform, accepted high
position in his household, and fled the country
upon the Emperor’s return. At the castle of
Bamberg, in Bavaria, he saw the Russians
pouring by on their march to France. Overcome
by the miseries of his situation, the remorseful
traitor threw himself from an upper
window and died on the pavement below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p><em>Where was Murat?</em> The most brilliant
cavalry officer that the world ever saw had
offered his sword to Napoleon, and had been
spurned. God! what a mistake. The Emperor,
who had retained Fouché, and given a
command to Bourmont, might well have
trusted his own brother-in-law, who had everything
to gain by a victory which would restore
the fortunes of all the Napoleonic connection.
But Murat had appeared in arms
against France, and this Napoleon would not
forgive. Besides, he had attacked the Austrians,
with whose Emperor there is reason to
believe that Napoleon had come to an understanding
before leaving Elba. Murat’s insane
conduct not only brought ruin upon himself,
but destroyed whatever chance Napoleon
had to detach Austria from the Alliance. So
it was that Murat was in concealment at
Toulon while the battle raged at Waterloo.</p>

<p>Greatest of Napoleon’s Marshals was Davout,
the victor of Auerstadt—a greater feat
of arms than Napoleon’s own triumph at
Jena on the same day. But he was wasted
during the Hundred Days. He begged hard
for a command, but the Emperor chose to
have him remain in Paris, Minister of War,
and thus the great soldier who might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
given such a different account of the Prussians,
had he instead of Grouchy been sent after
them, sat useless in the office in Paris, while
the cannon roared at Fluerus, at Ligny, at
Quatre Bras, at Wavre, at La Belle Alliance.
Soult was a commander of ability, and he was
loyal and full of zeal; but he had long held
independent command, had practically no experience
as a staff-officer; and yet he applied
for and was given the position of Chief of
Staff. This unfortunate choice proved to be
one of the principal causes of the disaster of
the campaign.</p>

<p><em>And where was Ney?</em> Where was Napoleon’s
“Bravest of the brave”?—the heroic
figure that had held the rearguard all
through the horrors of the Retreat from Moscow;
the impatient lieutenant who had almost
used threats of personal violence to his Emperor
to compel him to sign the first abdication;
the turn-coat who had gone over to the
Bourbons, and who had promised the King to
bring Napoleon to Paris in an iron cage?</p>

<p>The torrent which was bearing the exile
back to his throne proved too strong for Ney;
and when his own troops cried, “<i lang="fr">Vive L’Empereur!</i>”
Ney was swept off his feet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
When the big-hearted, impulsive man began
to make explanations and denials, Napoleon
stopped him with, “Embrace me, Ney.”</p>

<p>Weeks afterward, when the Marshal felt
that the Emperor must have learned about the
iron cage threat, he was clumsy enough to
mention the matter to Napoleon, and to claim
that he merely made the remark to deceive the
King as to his real design, which was to go
over to the returning Emperor. Napoleon
said nothing, but gave Ney one of those looks
which made even Vandamme grow ill at ease.</p>

<p>Mortified, feeling that he had blundered
throughout,—in 1814 and in 1815,—Ney
withdrew to his estate.</p>

<p>Only at the last moment, and then out of
pity, did Napoleon send word to Ney that he
might serve. The message was fatal—for it
cost Napoleon his throne, and Ney his life.</p>

<p>It was not until the 12th of June that Ney
set out for the army, and he was so ill prepared
that he made the journey to Avesnes in
a coach, and from there to Beaumont in a
peasant’s cart. It was that evening that he
bought from Marshal Mortier the horses he
rode into battle. At the head of his army,
Napoleon was cordial to his old lieutenant.
“I am glad to see you, Ney. You will take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
command of 1st and 2nd Army Corps. Drive
the enemy on the Brussels road, and take possession
of Quatre Bras.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>What of the composition and temper of the
army with which the great Captain was to
make his last campaign?</p>

<p>The officers did not possess the confidence
of the troops, and were themselves without
confidence in the star of Napoleon. Even
those generals who were at heart his friends
and were ready to die by him, had little or no
hope of success. How could it be otherwise?
Napoleon could not inspire others with a faith
which he did not himself feel; and we have
overwhelming evidence to the effect that he
was depressed, filled with forebodings.</p>

<p>It was in the troops of the rank and file that
confidence lay. These were in a frenzy of enthusiasm
for their Emperor, and of hatred
against his enemies. In their way of judging
events, their Captain had never been defeated.
The Russian snows had been the cause of his
failure in 1812, and the treachery of his Marshals
had been his ruin in the Campaign of
1813 and 1814. Nothing but treachery
could check him now; but that there <em>was</em>
treason afoot was a universal suspicion among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
the men of the rank and file. “Don’t trust the
Marshals,” they were constantly saying; and
even at Waterloo a soldier ran from the
ranks, caught the bridle rein of the white
Arabian mare that the Emperor rode, and exclaimed,
“Sire, don’t trust Marshal Soult!
He betrays you!” “Be calm. Trust Marshal
Soult, and trust me,” was Napoleon’s
reply. Evidently here was an army that would
strike with terrific force, but which might
<em>break all to pieces on the field at the slightest
evidence of bad faith on the part of its commanders</em>.</p>

<p>At the very outset, Soult’s unfitness for
his position as Chief of Staff was demonstrated.
When orders to concentrate the
army were flying as fast as couriers could
bear them, Napoleon came upon the cavalry
of Grouchy, at Laon, before that officer had
stirred a step. <em>He had received no orders.</em>
Had Napoleon been the vigilant, quickly resolute
Captain of old, his Chief of Staff
would have been dismissed at once. Like the
leak in the dyke, <em>such</em> a mistake indicated the
danger of a colossal disaster. In person, Napoleon
had to order Grouchy forward; and
practically the same thing had to be done with
the corps of Vandamme. Soult had sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
marching orders to that officer <em>by a single
courier</em>, whose horse fell with him, breaking
his leg; and the poor fellow lay there all
night with the undelivered order.</p>

<p>Both of these delays were felt throughout
the campaign. The cavalry had to make a
forced march of 20 leagues and this tired the
horses; and in the cavalry charges of the following
days the mounts of the French were
jaded, while those of the enemy were fresh.
Vandamme’s failure to get his orders caused
the combination of the Emperor to fall short
of what it ought to have accomplished, and
this in turn caused other losses to the end of
the campaign.</p>

<p>Even at this late day the armies of Blücher
and Wellington were spread over a front line
of 35 leagues. The base of the Prussians was
Liege; that of the English, Brussels and
Ghent. The point of contact of the two
armies was the road from Charleroi to Brussels.
Napoleon determined to seize this road,
strike the Allies at the point of contact and
drive them apart, so that he could crush each
in detail. This done, he believed that Austria
would withdraw from the Alliance, the Belgians
rise in his favor, Italy assert her friendship
for him, and all France unite against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
Bourbons. If these very probable changes
should take place, he could either conclude an
honorable peace with Russia, Prussia, and
Great Britain, or he could safely defy them.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>On the 14th of June the Emperor slept
among his troops. Next morning he addressed
them in the order of the day:</p>

<p>“Soldiers, to-day is the anniversary of Marengo
and Friedland, which twice decided the
fate of Europe. We were too generous after
Austerlitz and Wagram. And now banded
together against us, the sovereigns we left on
their thrones conspire against the independence
and the most sacred rights of France.
They have begun by the most iniquitous aggression.
Let us march to meet them; are we
not the men we were then? The time has
come for every Frenchman who loves his
country to conquer or to die.”</p>

<p>The army of 124,000 men to whom those
burning words were addressed had been swiftly
concentrated within cannon-shot of the
enemy, before Blücher or Wellington had the
faintest idea of what had happened. While
it was possible for the French Emperor to
strike at once, with the crushing weight of the
whole army, <em>three days</em> were necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
Blücher and Wellington. <em>How did they get
those three days?</em> Through the blunders and
disobedience of Napoleon’s own officers.
Contributing immensely to the same result
was the refusal of Wellington’s officers to obey
the orders which he sent from Brussels and
which, had they been obeyed, would have left
Quatre Bras in the hands of the French, and
put Napoleon in overwhelming numbers <em>between</em>
the scattered forces of his enemies. To
have destroyed them would have been child’s
play for such a captain.</p>

<p>On the 15th of June, Wellington wrote to
the Czar of Russia stating his intention to
take the offensive at the end of the month.
As to Blücher, that indomitable but short-sighted
soldier was writing to his wife, “We
shall soon enter France. We might remain
here a year, for Bonaparte would never attack
us.”</p>

<p>About the time that the wife of “Marshal
Forwards” was reading this reassuring letter,
the Prussian army was flying before the
French Emperor, and old Blücher himself, unhorsed
and bruised almost to unconsciousness,
had escaped capture because of the darkness,
and was being borne off the lost field of
Ligny.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p>On the morning of June 15th, at half-past
three, the French army crossed the Belgian
frontier.</p>

<p>Disobeying orders, D’Erlon did not set his
troops in motion until half-past four. Receiving
no orders, Vandamme did not move
at all—not until the approach of Lobau’s
corps warned him that some mistake had been
made. Gérard was ordered to start at three;
he did not appear at the rendezvous until
seven.</p>

<p>To increase the ill effect which these delays
were making upon the mind of the suspicious
troops, General Bourmont, commander of the
head division of the 4th Corps, went over to
the enemy, accompanied by his staff, some
other officers, and an escort of five lancers.</p>

<p>This act of treachery threw the whole of
the 4th Corps into confusion, and it became
necessary for Gérard and General Hulot to
harangue the troops to restore their confidence.
Two hours were thus lost. Napoleon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
had not wished to give Bourmont a command,
but had yielded at the urgent entreaties of
Gérard and Labedoyére.</p>

<p>To the credit of Blücher, it must be said
that he gave the traitor a contemptuous reception,
and spoke to his staff scornfully of the
“cur.”</p>

<p>Between nine and ten o’clock on the morning
of the 15th of June the French reached
the Sambre. At Thuin, at Ham, in the
woods of Montigny, at the farm of La Tombe
they had struck the Prussian outposts and
driven them, killing, wounding and capturing
some 500 of them. Then there was a fight
for the bridge over the Sambre at Marchienne.</p>

<p>Too much time was lost both here and at
the bridge of Charleroi. The cavalry awaited
the infantry, and Vandamme, commander
of the infantry, was four hours late. It was
not until the Emperor himself appeared on the
scene that the bridge was stormed.</p>

<p>At the bridge of Marchienne there was a
fight of two hours, and even after the bridge
had been carried it required several hours for
so many troops to pass so narrow a bridge.</p>

<p>To a civilian it seems strange that no preparation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
had been made, beforehand, to throw
other bridges over this stream; equally so
that the retreating Prussians left any bridges
standing.</p>

<p>Amid the cheers of the inhabitants Napoleon
entered Charleroi, a little after noon, and
dismounted, and sat down by the side of the
road. At this point he commanded a full
view of the valley of the Sambre.</p>

<p>The troops were on the march. As they
passed they recognized the Emperor, and the
wildly enthusiastic cheering of the men
drowned the roll of the drums. Soldiers
broke ranks to run and hug the neck of Desirée,
the Emperor’s horse.</p>

<p>And so tired was Napoleon that he fell
asleep in the chair, even as he had slept on the
battlefield of Jena.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>From Brussels the English would come by
the Charleroi road; from Namur the Prussians
would come by the Nivelles road.
These highways cross each other at Quatre
Bras, hence the supreme importance of that
position. To seize it was Napoleon’s purpose,
and he entrusted the task to Ney, giving
him the order verbally and personally:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>“Drive the enemy on the Brussels road and
take up your position at Quatre Bras.”</p>

<p>Having ordered the left wing of his army
to Quatre Bras, the Emperor meant to post
his right wing at Sombreff, while he, himself,
with his reserve, should take position at Fluerus,
to be ready to act with the right wing or
the left, as circumstances might dictate.</p>

<p>About 10,000 Prussians were behind Gilly,
protected in front by the little stream, Le
Grand-Rieux. Grouchy, deceived by the
length of the enemy’s line, estimated their
strength at 20,000, and hesitated to advance.
“At most they are 10,000,” said the Emperor,
and he ordered Grouchy to ford the stream
and take the Prussians in flank; Vandamme’s
division and Pajol’s cavalry would attack in
front.</p>

<p>Then the Emperor left the field to hurry
the coming of Vandamme’s corps. The moment
Napoleon was gone, Grouchy and Vandamme
began to waste time, and for two
hours they were arranging the details of the
movement. While they were doing so, the
Prussians quietly walked off from the trap.</p>

<p>Enraged at the conduct of his lieutenants,
the Emperor, just returned, ordered Letort to
charge with four squadrons of cavalry. Two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
battalions of Prussians were overtaken and
cut to pieces; the others escaped into the
woods of Solielmont.</p>

<p>It was now the close of the day, and
Grouchy wished to drive out of Fluerus the
two battalions of Prussians which occupied it.
These were the positive orders of the Emperor,
but Marshal Vandamme refused to advance
any farther, saying that his troops were
too tired and that, at any rate, he would take
no orders from a commandant of the cavalry.
As Grouchy could not take Fluerus without
the support of infantry, the village remained
untaken, and Napoleon’s plan incomplete.</p>

<p>On the left wing the same failure to obey
orders was even more marked. Instead of
advancing upon Quatre Bras, as the Emperor
distinctly told him to do, Ney posted three of
his divisions at Gosselies, and tolled off nothing
but the lancers and the chasseurs of the
Guard to Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>The lancers of the Guard had got in sight
of Fresnes about half-past five in the afternoon.
This village was occupied by a Nassau
battalion and a battery of horse artillery.
They were under the command of Major
Normann, who had been left without any instructions,
but on hearing the sound of cannon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
toward Gosselies, he had at once divined the
supreme importance of Quatre Bras, and determined
to defend it desperately. Had Ney
continued his advance with any considerable
portion of his infantry, the Nassau battalion
would have been crushed. As it was, the
small force of the French which had been sent
forward was able to drive Major Normann
out of Fresnes and along the Brussels road.
In fact a squadron of the French cavalry entered
Quatre Bras where there were then no
English; but fearing to be cut off, did not attempt
to hold the place. Prince Bernard,
of Saxe-Weimar, had also acted without orders;
and with the instinct of a soldier had
taken the responsibility of moving his own
troops to occupy this important strategical
position. Under him were four Nassau battalions;
therefore there were now 4,500 men
with artillery to defend Quatre Bras against
the 1,700 lancers and chasseurs which Ney
had thrown forward.</p>

<p>The sound of cannon in front caused Marshal
Ney to join his vanguard. Instead of
realizing the necessity of ordering up infantry
supports and storming the position of the
enemy as he could easily have done, he made
only a few feeble charges against the Nassau<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
infantry, and then went back to Gosselies for
the night. Had he continued to advance with
even one-fourth of the troops which the Emperor
had given, he might have destroyed the
entire force of Prince Bernard and of Major
Normann before a single Englishman came
within miles of the place.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Emperor had substantially
gained his point. Almost without any real
fighting, and in spite of the clumsy working
of his great military machine, he now had
124,000 men encamped near the point of
junction between the allied armies, ready to
strike either. On the night of the 15th, when,
at Charleroi, Napoleon examined the reports
sent in by Grouchy and Ney, he reached a conclusion
that was wrong, but which, fastening
itself on his mind, could never be shaken, and
contributed vastly to his ruin. He believed,
judging from the direction in which the Prussians
had retreated, that they were retreating
upon Liege, their natural base of operations,
instead of adhering to the design of so conducting
their retreat as to be at all times in
reach of the English.</p>

<p>The various delays of the French, and their
failure to advance as far as the Emperor’s orders
had directed, made it possible for the indefatigable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
Blücher to bring up a large part
of his army, and instead of retreating on his
base,—as Napoleon thought he would do,—Blücher
advanced to Sombreffe to give battle.</p>

<p>Toward morning, in the night of the 15th,
the Prussians had evacuated Fluerus.
Grouchy took possession of it, and the Emperor
reached it shortly before noon. Going to
the tower of a brick mill, which stood at the
end of Fluerus, Napoleon had the roof
breached and a platform made, upon which he
could stand and view the various positions of
the enemy.</p>

<p>The willingness of the Prussian commander
to fight was partly the result of Wellington’s
diplomacy. The Englishman had been
caught napping, and to secure time to concentrate
his badly scattered forces he had given
Blücher a written promise to support him. It
was extremely necessary to Wellington that
Blücher should stand between the English
army and the French, and fight them off, until
the English could get themselves together.
Besides, if Blücher retreated upon Liege, the
English army would be left alone before Napoleon.
In that event it would have to fight
with inferior forces, or fall back on its base of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
operations, leaving Brussels to be occupied by
the Emperor.</p>

<p>In 1876 there was found in the Prussian
archives the letter in which Wellington encouraged
his ally to make a stand. This letter
was sent from the heights north of Fresnes,
about two miles south of Quatre Bras, at half-past
ten o’clock in the morning of the 16th.
In this much-debated letter the wily Englishman
misrepresents the positions of his own
troops, puts them some hours nearer to the
scene of action than they really were, and assures
Blücher of their support if he will stand
and fight. Wellington tells Blücher that
he will at least be able to effect such a powerful
diversion in his behalf that Napoleon will
not be able to use against the Prussian more
than a moiety of his army.</p>

<p>Lord Wolseley, in his book, “The Decline
and Fall of Napoleon,” admits that Wellington’s
statements to Blücher were false, but
naively remarks, “Wellington, an English
gentleman of the highest type, was wholly and
absolutely incapable of anything bordering on
untruth or deceit in dealing with his allies.”</p>

<p>Lord Wolseley’s ingenious explanation is
that Wellington must have been deceived “by
his inefficient staff.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>Yet the undisputed record is that Wellington
himself had issued all the orders to his
scattered troops, a few hours before, and he
knew precisely the distance of each division
from the field.</p>

<p>To the “English gentleman of the highest
type” it was supremely necessary that his ally
should break the force of the French onset,
delay its advance, and thus give himself time
to concentrate his too-widely scattered troops.
To influence Blücher he stated to him what he
<em>knew</em> to be untrue, and made his ally a promise
which he <em>knew</em> he could not keep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p>The Napoleon of the Italian campaign had
said: “The Austrians lose battles because
they do not know the value of fifteen
minutes.”</p>

<p>Alas! Neither the Emperor nor his lieutenants
now seemed to know the value of time.</p>

<p>In former years the French moved forward
before dawn. In this final campaign,
upon which all was staked, they started late
and they moved slowly, when the enemy was
crowding into every minute the utmost that
human energy could achieve.</p>

<p>Standing upon the roof of the mill-tower,
Napoleon could not perceive the full strength
of Blücher’s position. To the Emperor it
seemed that the enemy was posted opposite to
him on a slope leading upward to a low range
of hills with the village of Sombreff in the
center. From the tower he could not see the
importance of the small river Ligne, with the
ravine formed by the broken ground and the
stream itself. In the center of the valley was
the village of Ligny, in which stood an old
castle, and a church surrounded by a cemetery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
enclosed by brick walls. Through this village
runs the stream of Ligne. There were several
other villages in the valley between the two
opposing ranges of hills. The Prussian position
was in reality strong, with this weakness—the
open slope revealed all the movements
made over it, and exposed the troops to the
cannon of the French.</p>

<p>It was not till long after two o’clock that
the French were ready to attack. Then the
battery of the Guard fired the signal guns,
and Vandamme dashed upon the enemy,
while the military bands played “La victoire
enchantant.” The Prussians posted in the
village, the cemetery, the church, the orchards,
the houses, fought desperately. Entrenched
in the old castle and in the farm
buildings, they raked the advancing French
with a terrible fire, which littered the ground
with the dead and wounded. Under the cannonade
of the French, houses burst into
flames. The villages became a roaring hell,
in which the maddened soldiers fought from
house to house, in the streets, in the square,
with a ferocity which amazed the oldest officers.
No quarter was asked or given.</p>

<p>Driven over the Ligne, the Prussians lined
the left bank, and across this brook the soldiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
shot each other, with guns only a few
feet apart. In the houses wounded men were
being burned to death, and their frightful
cries rang out above the roar of battle. The
hot day of June was made hotter by the fierce
flames which wrapped the buildings; clouds
hung in the heavens, and the smoke from the
guns, dense and foul, was pierced by tongues
of fire from the blazing houses and by the
flashes of the guns as Prussians and Frenchmen
shot each other down.</p>

<p>After four charges in force; after sanguinary
hand-to-hand fights for every hedge and
wall and house; after the fiercest struggle for
the brook, the Prussians fell back—the
French pouring over the bridges. That
Blücher had failed to blow up the bridges
was a disastrous mistake.</p>

<p>But this was only the right wing of
Blücher’s army; the center and the left wing
were unhurt. Blücher came down from his
observatory, on the roof of the mill of Bussy,
to order in person a movement on Wagnalée,
from which the Prussians would take the
French in flank. While the Prussians, reanimated
by the presence of “Old Marshal Forwards,”
sprang forward with cheers, and began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
to drive the French back, Napoleon
made ready for his master-stroke.</p>

<p>Ney at Quatre Bras is in the rear of the
Prussians. Let him merely hold in check
whatever force of English is coming from
Brussels, and detach D’Erlon with his 20,000
men to fall upon the Prussian flank and rear.
This done, 60,000 Prussians will be slaughtered
or captured.</p>

<p>Directly to D’Erlon flew the order to
march to the rear of the Prussian right. Colonel
de Forbin-Janson, who carried the order
to D’Erlon, was instructed to inform Ney,
also.</p>

<p>This order had been sent at two o’clock.
It was now half-past five. At six the Emperor
expected to hear the thunder of D’Erlon’s
cannon in the rear of the Prussian army.
As soon as he should hear that he would send
in his reserves,—hurling them at the enemy’s
center,—cut through, block its retreat on Sombreff,
and drive it back upon the guns of Vandamme
and D’Erlon. For the 60,000 men
of Zeiten and Pirch there would be no escape.
The Emperor was greatly elated. In
order to annihilate Blücher and end the war
with a clap of thunder it was only necessary
that Ney obey orders. So thought Napoleon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
He said to Gérard, “It is possible
that three hours hence the fate of the war
may be decided.” To Ney himself he had
written, “The fate of France is in your
hands.”</p>

<p>With a soul full of the pride of success,
the Emperor made his dispositions for the
final blow.</p>

<p>But what thunder-cloud is that which suddenly
darkens the radiant sky?</p>

<p>Away off there to the left, Vandamme’s
scouts have caught sight of a column of
twenty or thirty thousand troops who
march as if their intention is to turn the
French flank. An aide-de-camp sent by Vandamme
dashes across the field to carry this
fateful message to the Emperor. Thus, with
hand uplifted to strike Blücher down, he
must not deal the blow—his own flank is exposed.
It does not occur to Napoleon that
this column on the left may be D’Erlon’s
corps, going in a wrong direction, by mistake.
Vandamme had said they were the enemy;
D’Erlon had no business to be <em>there</em>; the
column <em>must</em> be Prussian or English.</p>

<p>Nothing can be done until an aide-de-camp
can ride several miles, reconnoiter, ride back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
and report. The grand attack is delayed
until this can be done.</p>

<p>At length the aide-de-camp returns and reports
that the suspicious column is D’Erlon’s
corps.</p>

<p>Filled with chagrin for not having guessed
as much, and with rage for the precious
hour of daylight lost, the Emperor gives the
word, the grand attack begins.</p>

<p>Black clouds have been gathering over the
winding stream of Ligne, along whose banks
the fighting has raged for several miles. The
lightning now begins to flash and the thunder
to roll, but even the voice of the storm is lost
in the more terrible voice of battle as Napoleon’s
batteries turn every gun on Ligny.</p>

<p>The Old Guard deploys in columns of attack;
cuirassiers make ready to dash forward;
the drums beat the charge, and the
splendid array moves onward amid deafening
peals of “<i lang="fr">Vive l’Empereur!</i>”</p>

<p>Blücher has stripped his center to feed his
right: he has no reserves: and the whole
strength of Napoleon’s power smites the
Prussian center. It is swept away. As Soult
wrote Davout: “It was like a scene on the
stage.”</p>

<p>The sun is now about to go down—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
storm is over—and Blücher gets a view of the
whole field. His army has been cut in two.
Desperately he calls in the troops on his
right; desperately he gallops to his squadrons
on the left to lead them to the charge.
Bravely they come on in the gathering gloom
to fling themselves against the French. In
vain—torn by musketry and charged by the
cuirassiers, they fall back. Blücher’s horse is
shot down and falls on his rider.</p>

<p>“Nostitz, now I am lost!” cries the old
hero to his adjutant.</p>

<p>But the French dash by without noticing
these two Prussians, and when the Prussians,
in a countercharge, pass over the same
ground, Blücher’s horse is lifted and the old
Marshal borne from the field.</p>

<p>Night puts an end to the conflict and saves
the Prussian army from annihilation. Had
the attack been made when Napoleon first
ordered, there would have been no Blücher
to rescue Wellington at Mont-Saint-Jean.</p>

<p>The carnage of the day had been prodigious.
Twelve thousand Prussians and
eighty-five hundred Frenchmen strewed the
villages, the ravine, and the plain. At this
cost the great Captain won his last victory.</p>

<p>As he returned to Fluerus that night Napoleon’s
heart must have been very heavy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
The fortune of France had slipped through
his fingers. The enemy should have been destroyed.
Had his orders been obeyed,
Blücher’s army would have been swept off the
face of the earth. As it was, Blücher had
simply received one of the ordinary drubbings
to which he was so much accustomed that he
was not even discouraged. Neither his staff
nor his troops were demoralized. They had
given way to an onset which they could not
withstand; but they meant to reform, retreat
to another position, and fight again.</p>

<p>Most of those who have written of Ligny
and of the fatality which deprived both Ney
and the Emperor of D’Erlon,—whose corps
would have accomplished such decisive results
had it gone into action at either Ligny
or Quatre Bras,—dwell upon the ignorance
and presumption of the staff-officer, Col. Laurent,
who took it upon himself to direct the
march of D’Erlon’s leading column upon
Ligny when it was upon its way to Quatre
Bras.</p>

<p>But it seems to me that had the staff-officer
not turned D’Erlon’s corps away from
Quatre Bras and toward Ligny, the Emperor’s
own order, sent by Forbin-Janson,
would have brought about precisely the same
result.</p>

<p>“There is my ugly boy, Arthur,” said Lady
Mornington on seeing Wellington at the
Dublin Theater after a long absence.</p>

<p>Like Alexander the Great, Charlemagne,
Frederick the Great, Washington, Byron,
Webster, Disraeli, and many other great
men, Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington,
owed nothing to his mother!</p>

<p>The sentimental notion that all great men
derive their strength from their mothers is an
idle fancy.</p>

<p>Born into the ruling caste of Great Britain,
Arthur Wellesley was given the best opportunities,
and he improved them to the best
advantage. In Hindustan he won military
fame similar to that of Clive, and was finally
sent to Portugal when the British Cabinet decided
to make the Peninsula a base of operations
against Napoleon. Displeased with
the Convention of Cintra, which his superior
officer concluded with Junot, after the latter
had lost the battle of Vimiera, Wellington
quit the Continent and returned to England,
where he served in Parliament. It required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the utmost exertion of his family influence to
again secure employment for him in the army.</p>

<p>His subsequent career in Spain, where, by
a cautious steadiness and unflinching courage,
he won victory after victory over Napoleon’s
lieutenants, left him the military hero of the
day when Marmont’s treachery had put an
end to the campaign of 1814.</p>

<p>He was at the Vienna Congress when Napoleon
left Elba, and the Kings turned to
him, saying: “You must once more save Europe.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The Duke of Wellington, associated as he
is with the national pride of the country, is
England’s military hero. The greatness of
the Duke is the greatness of old England.
He identified himself wholly with the government
of his country, believed that it was the
best that human wit could devise, antagonized
innovations, detested reform measures,
and had a hearty contempt for the populace.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if any human being ever
<em>loved</em> Wellington. His wife did not; his
sons did not; his officers did not; his soldiers
did not. Yet he had the unbounded confidence
of his army, the warm admiration of
most Englishmen, and the personal esteem of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
every sovereign of Europe. Like Washington,
he had few intimacies; and like Washington,
he was exacting even in very small
matters.</p>

<p>That he should have won the title of “the
Iron Duke” is significant. In many respects
he was a hard man. <em>He was never known to
laugh.</em></p>

<p>“Kiss me, Hardy,” said the dying Nelson
to his bosom friend. We cannot imagine any
such tenderness of sentiment in Wellington.</p>

<p>Nelson came near throwing his fame away
for a wanton, as Marc Antony did: we could
never imagine Wellington in love with a
woman. He married with as little excitement
as he managed a military maneuver,
and he begat children from a stern sense of
duty.</p>

<p>He heartily favored flogging in the army,
and he bitterly opposed penny postage.</p>

<p>In his old age he was asked whether he
found any advantage in being “great.” He
answered, “Yes, I can afford to do without
servants. I brush my own clothes, and if I
was strong enough I would black my own
shoes.”</p>

<p>He had ridden horseback all his life, but
had a notoriously bad seat. Often in a fox<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
hunt he gave his horse a fall, or was thrown.
Like Napoleon, he always shaved himself.
He was a man of few words, never lost his
head, and was as brave as Julius Caesar.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>It is Thackeray who relates the incident
which illustrates how the English regarded
the Duke in his old age.</p>

<p>Two urchins, one a Londoner and the other
not, see a soldierly figure ride by along the
street.</p>

<p>“‘That’s the Duke,’ says the Londoner.</p>

<p>“‘The Duke?’ questions the other.</p>

<p>“‘Of Wellington, booby!’ exclaims the
Londoner, scornful of the ignoramus who
did not know that when one spoke of ‘the
Duke,’ Wellington alone <em>could</em> be meant.”</p>

    <div class="verse indentq">“There was a sound of revelry by night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And Belgium’s capital had gathered then</div>

<p>The dance is the harmony of motion wedded
to the harmony of sound. Since men
have loved music they have loved dancing,
and the perfection of the dance will be a fascination
until the love of music is dead in
the souls of men.</p>

<p>Herodias dances before the King, and off
goes the head of John—a victim to the sensuous
poetry of motion. Nor was Herod
the only intoxicated monarch whose imperial
will was seduced by music and the dance.
Ancient history is full of it—this witchery of
voluptuous music and voluptuous motion, the
sway of the woman of the dance.</p>

<p>As far back as we can see into the dim ages
of the past, the record is the same. The story
of the witchery of melodious sound and the
rhythmical movement which brings the charm
of music to the eye as well as to the ear, is
traced in whatever of sculpture, of painting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
of literature has been saved from the ravages
of time. Graven on the stone, carved
upon the frieze, cast in the entablature, delicately
wreathed about the vase, we still see
how the ancients loved music, and how the
music made the dance.</p>

<p>Out of the annals of the dead nations
come the living names of their national
dances, and it may be that the fire which
burned in the heart of the Spartan when he
went through the Pyrrhic dance was the same
as that which kindled the ardor of the Red
Man of the American tribes when he celebrated
his war dance.</p>

<p>There was the dance of the Furies, the
dance of the Harvest, the dance of May-day,
the dance of the religious rite, the dance of rejoicing,
the dance of the marriage feast, the
dance of the funeral rite.</p>

<p>In the Greek Chorus the whole city gave
itself to the melody of sound and the harmony
of motion, just as the <i lang="fr">farandola</i> of to-day is,
in Southern France, an unlooped garland of
music and dance drawing into itself the entire
community. Only the Roman refused to
dance, and the Roman is the most unlovely
national character in history.</p>

<p>“Wine, woman, and song!” cried the revellers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
in the dawn of time; “Wine, woman,
and song!” shout the revellers now; and between
these flowery banks of Pleasure runs
the steady, everlasting stream of earnest purpose,
consecration to duty, and love of noble
standards, that bears precious freight toward
havens yet unknown.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>As Thackeray says, there never was, since
the days of Darius, such a brilliant train of
camp-followers as hung around Wellington’s
army in the Low Countries, in the year 1815.</p>

<p>French noblesse who had fled their country,
English lords and ladies who had crossed
over to the Continent, diplomats connected
with various European courts, travellers who
had stopped at Brussels to await the issues of
the campaign—all these crowded the city.
With the officers of the English and Belgian
armies, this made a brilliant and distinguished
society, and many social entertainments were
being given.</p>

<p>Owing principally to the fact that hers
was connected with the march of the English
army and the crowning victory of Waterloo,
the Duchess of Richmond’s ball has, historically,
obliterated every other. Lord Byron
immortalized it in “Childe Harold”; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
after him came Thackeray with his masterly
descriptions in “Vanity Fair.”</p>

<p>Until a comparatively recent date it has not
been known for certain where the ball took
place, for it was well known that it was not
given in the house which the Duke of Richmond
was temporarily occupying.</p>

<p>Sir William Fraser has published a most
interesting account of how his industrious
search for the famous ball-room was at length
rewarded by the discovery that the place actually
used for the dance was the store-room, or
dépot, of a carriage-builder, whose establishment
joined the rear of the Duke of Richmond’s
palace. Instead of being a “high-hall”
as Byron imagined, it was a low room,
13 feet high, 54 feet broad, and 120 feet
long. For the two hundred invited guests it
afforded ample accommodations.</p>

<p>We can assume that this storage-room for
vehicles had been transformed with hangings
and decorations until it presented an appearance
sufficiently brilliant, and we can imagine
the eagerness with which “the beauty and the
chivalry” had looked forward to this night.
We can imagine the intrigues for tickets. We
can imagine fair women leaning on the arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
of the brave men, and the crash of music, as
the band strikes up, and then,</p>

<p>“On with the dance!”</p>

<p>Yonder is the Prince of Orange, heir to
the illustrious house which boasts such names
as William III and William the Silent. To
whom does the modern world owe more,—for
freedom of conscience, of speech, of person,—than
to the heroic Dutchman who
stood, almost alone—and triumphantly!—against
the whole power of the Spanish Empire
and the Pope? From whom have we
received a finer lesson in patriotism, and in
desperate determination to be free, than from
William III when, as the armies of the Grand
Monarch came irresistibly on, sternly ordered,
“<em>Cut the dykes! We’ll give Holland back
to the sea, rather than become the slaves of
France!</em>”</p>

<p>Over there is the Duke of Brunswick—whose
father, in 1789, had led into France
that ill-fated invasion which struggled with
mud and rain and green grapes until it was
in condition to be demoralized by the slight
cannonade of Dumouriez and the cavalry
charge of Kellerman—thus bringing derision
upon its commander who had issued the famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
proclamation in which he threatened
Paris with destruction.</p>

<p>There is Pozzo di Borgo, the Corsican,
the boyhood acquaintance of Napoleon.
They had taken different sides in petty Corsican
politics; there had been an affray at the
polls, Pozzo had been knocked down and
roughly handled by the Bonaparte faction.
Here was the origin of one of the most active,
vindictive and persistent hatreds on record;
and there is no doubt whatever that the Corsican
gentleman who now glitters in this brilliant
throng, in the Duchess of Richmond’s
ball-room, has done Napoleon a vast deal of
harm. It was he, more than any other, who
influenced the Emperor Alexander against
Napoleon. It was he, more than any other,
who in 1814 persuaded the Allies to revoke
the order, already given, to retreat upon the
Rhine and, instead, to march straight upon
Paris.</p>

<p>More notable still, is another opponent of
Napoleon whom we see in this famous ball-room.
It is Sir Sydney Smith. “<em>That man
caused me to miss my destiny!</em>” exclaimed Napoleon.
For Sir Sydney was the unconquerable
Englishman who threw himself into
Acre and showed the Turks how to defend it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
Against those walls the French dashed themselves
in vain. Baffled, exhausted, his rear
threatened, his heart filled with impotent
rage, Napoleon had to abandon his gorgeous
visions of Eastern conquest and drink to the
dregs a bitter cup of humiliation.</p>

<p>Of course the Duke of Wellington is here,
and many of the officers of his army. The
French nobles (emigrés) are represented by
some of the proudest names of the <em>Ancient
Régime</em>. Ladies of high degree are present—ladies
of beauty, wit, and grace, some from
Belgium, France, England, but none of these
are so well known as a certain pretty, doting,
neglected wife named Amelia, and a dashing,
brilliant, wicked adventuress, Becky Sharp,
whom Thackeray brings to the ball. As long
as there is such a thing as English literature
these two, together with the prodigal George
Osborne and honest William Dobbin, will
move amid those revellers and live amid the
stirring scenes of the Eve of Waterloo.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“A thousand hearts beat happily; and when</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Music arose with its voluptuous swell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soft eyes looked love to eyes that spake again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And all went merrily as a marriage bell.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was no boom of cannon to halt the
dance. There was no opening roar of battle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
that broke in upon the revelry. The Duke
of Wellington sat down comfortably to the
table where the midnight supper was served,
and the officers remained at the ball hours
later. Then, as they had been ordered, they
withdrew quietly, one by one, and finally the
Duke came to make his own adieus.</p>

<p>The youngest daughter of the Duchess of
Richmond was awakened and brought down
to the ball-room. With her tiny fingers she
buckled on the great soldier’s sword.</p>

<p>Do we not all of us recall how Major
Dobbin seeks out Captain George, who has
been madly gaming and madly drinking?</p>

<p>“‘Hullo, Dob! Come and drink, old
Dob! The Duke’s wine is famous.’</p>

<p>“‘Come out, George,’ said Dobbin gravely.
‘Don’t drink.’</p>

<p>“Dobbin went up to him and whispered
something to him, at which George, giving a
start and a wild hurray, tossed off his glass,
clapped it on the table, and walked away
speedily on his friend’s arm.”</p>

<p>What Dobbin said was this: “The enemy
has crossed the Sambre: our left is already engaged.
Come away. We are to march in
three hours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“And there was mounting in hot haste; the steed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And near, the beat of the alarming drum</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roused up the soldier ere the morning star,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">While throng’d the citizens with terror dumb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or whispering, with white lips—‘The foe! They come, they come!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again, Thackeray: “The sun was just
rising as the march began—it was a gallant
sight—the band led the column, playing
the regimental march; then came the major
in command, riding upon Pyramus, his stout
charger; then marched the grenadiers, their
captain at their head; in the center were the
colors, borne by the senior and junior ensigns;
then George came marching at the head of his
company. He looked up, and smiled at
Amelia, and passed on; and even the sound
of music died away.” And Amelia and thousands
of other wives go back to wait, to weep,
to pray.</p>

<p>How hard it is to believe that after the officers
had hurried away to join their commands,
after the Duke of Wellington had
left, after every young man and young woman
in the ball-room <em>knew</em> that their late
partners were hastening to the battlefield, <em>the
ball should continue</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>Instead of being broken up by the booming
cannon and the agonizing leavetakings
imagined by Lord Byron, the revel went on
till morning, when it ended in the usual way.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Not until six in the morning of June 16th
did the Duke of Wellington leave Brussels,
and, had the orders which he issued the evening
before been carried out, he would have
found Ney between himself and the English
army, with the Prussians annihilated! Acting
upon their own responsibility, Major Normann
and the Prince of Saxe-Weimar had
taken possession of Quatre Bras. The
Prince of Orange’s Chief of Staff, Constant
Rebecque, delivered to the officers the written
orders of Wellington, but told them verbally,
in effect, not to obey. As a matter of fact,
these officers paid no attention to the written
orders, but acted upon their own judgment.
They could see for themselves what ought to
be done, and they did it. They all rushed to
Quatre Bras, determined to hold it at whatever
cost.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock, Wellington arrived, and he
congratulated General Perponcher on being
in possession of Quatre Bras, whose vital importance
he now recognized for the first time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p>Not being attacked at Quatre Bras, Wellington
rode to the heights of Brye to see,
for himself, what was going on at Ligny.
He and Blücher went up in the mill of Bussy,
from whose roof they could plainly see every
movement of the French.</p>

<p>It was now too late for the Prussians to escape
battle. Therefore, Wellington, in parting
from Blücher to return to Quatre Bras,
coolly said, “I will come to your support provided
I am not attacked myself.” To his
aide Wellington remarked, “If he fights here
he will be damnably licked.”</p>

<p>No wonder that Gneisenau, Chief of Staff
to Blücher, formed the opinion that Wellington
was a “master-knave.”</p>

<p>Had the Prussian hero, Blücher, been as
craftily selfish as Wellington, there would
have been no Waterloo.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Quatre Bras, Wellington
found that Ney had at last realized the
true meaning of the Emperor’s orders, and he
made frantic efforts to regain what he had
lost. Too late. Vainly Jerome Bonaparte
fights with desperate courage to win and hold
the Boissou wood: vainly Kellerman hurls
his handful of horsemen upon the ever-increasing
infantry of the enemy; vainly Ney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
exposes himself to the hottest fire, rallying
broken lines and leading them back to the
charge. Too late. Regiment after regiment
of the English army arrives. In hot haste,
the young officers, who, a few hours ago, had
been dancing at the Duchess of Richmond’s
ball, throw themselves into the fight, still in
the silk stockings and buckled shoes of the
ball-room.</p>

<p>So impetuous had been the assault of the
French that at first the English and Hanoverians
were driven. The Duke of Wellington,
narrowly escaping capture, was borne
backward by the rout. In person he rallied
his men and led a cavalry charge which broke
on the French line. Not until the coming up
of Picton’s division did the tide decisively
turn; but then the French, heavily outnumbered,
were worsted at all points.</p>

<p>“The fate of France is in your hands,” the
Emperor had written, and Ney had not understood.
All the hours of the morning of
the 16th he had not understood. Precious
hours had glided by unimproved. Now it is
afternoon, and at last Ney understands.</p>

<p>And it is too late. Were he the ally of
Wellington and Blücher, he could not serve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
them better. Were he the mortal enemy of
France, he could not serve her worse.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by the sudden consciousness
of his terrible mistake, the heroic Ney was
almost demented. “Oh, that all these English
balls were buried in my body!” Impotent
rage, vain remorse: <em>the English were up,
and all of Wellington’s delays and blunders
were remedied</em>.</p>

<p>Verily, those who say there is no such thing
as <em>Luck</em> have never studied the history of the
Hundred Days!</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The fatality of the day was, of course, the
pendulum swing of D’Erlon’s corps—a pendulum
which swung first toward Napoleon,
then toward Ney, reaching neither. Had
not the Emperor turned it back when on its
way to join Ney, Wellington would have been
crushed. Had not Ney recalled it when it
was in sight of the Emperor, Blücher would
have been destroyed. But Napoleon took it
away from Ney, and Ney took it away from
Napoleon, and neither got to use it.</p>

<p>D’Erlon’s corps of 20,000 men was utterly
lost to the French, although it was on the
march all day and burning to be in the fight.
Nothing in military history equals the ill-luck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
of this day. In the first place, Soult’s order
to D’Erlon was ambiguous. D’Erlon did not
understand it, and the inexperienced staff-officer,
Forbin-Janson, was unable to explain
it. This accounts for D’Erlon showing up at
the wrong place and creating consternation
among the French which delayed the final
blow and saved Blücher.</p>

<p>In the second place, Soult sent only one
staff-officer, and this one did not carry out orders.
<em>He did not inform Ney.</em></p>

<p>An experienced staff-officer would have understood
the necessity of notifying Ney of
the Emperor’s orders to D’Erlon, for the
Emperor had placed D’Erlon under the immediate
command of Ney. As it was, Marshal
Ney was needing D’Erlon as badly as
the Emperor needed him, and was expecting
him every minute. Therefore, he continued
to send urgent, peremptory orders that
D’Erlon should hasten to join him.</p>

<p>Even when General Delcambre, sent by
D’Erlon after D’Erlon was well on his way
back to Ligny, reported the retrograde movement
to Ney, the insubordinate Marshal flew
into a passion and sent General Delcambre
back with an imperative order that D’Erlon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
should march on Quatre Bras. In taking
upon himself to overrule his Emperor, he did
not even consider the lateness of the hour,
which made it impossible for D’Erlon to join
him in time to be of any service.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p>While it was not disorganized or demoralized,
Blücher’s army was in great peril. Two
of his army corps were concentrated at
Wavre, one was at Gembloux, and the fourth
at Wandesett. Had the French been vigilant,
these separated corps might have been
overwhelmed in detail. Through the carelessness
of videttes, the lack of enterprise in
the leaders of reconnoitering parties and the
unpardonable neglect of General Exelmans,
neither Napoleon nor Grouchy was informed
of the movement of the Prussian corps.</p>

<p>After Grouchy was given command of
33,000 troops to pursue the Prussians, the
delays in starting, the slowness of the march,
the lack of harmony between Grouchy and his
two lieutenants, Vandamme and Gérard,
made the “pursuit” the most futile on record.</p>

<p>How it was that an army of 70,000 Prussians
could get lost to the French, then found,
then lost again, is something that the untutored
civilian labors in vain to understand.</p>

<p>Yet that is the truth about it. The morning
after the battle of Ligny the French did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
not know what had become of the Prussian
army. They began to hunt for it. The
search was clumsy and far afield. But at
length Thielman’s corps was located at
Gembloux. Grouchy’s entire army might
have enveloped and crushed it. Not being
attacked, Thielman sensibly retired, and when
the French entered Gembloux they did not
even know what had become of those Prussians.
A strange “pursuit,” truly.</p>

<p>Although he still had two hours of daylight,
Grouchy decided that the “pursuit”
had been pushed far enough for one day, and
he postponed further activities until the morrow.
During the night he received intelligence
that the whole Prussian army was
marching on Wavre. That Wavre was on a
parallel line to the line of Wellington’s retreat,
and that Blücher’s purpose might be to
succor Wellington when necessary never once
entered Grouchy’s head. On the contrary, he
believed that Blücher was making for Brussels
and would not tarry at Wavre. Yet he
knew that the Emperor was expecting a battle
<em>just where that of the next day was fought</em>.</p>

<p>Then why not put his 33,000 men nearer
to the Emperor than Blücher would be to
Wellington? To do so he had but to cross<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
the little river Dyle and march along its left
bank. Wavre is on the left bank of the Dyle,
and therefore he would have to cross it in any
event, going to Wavre. And by maneuvering
on that side of the river he could the more
readily keep in communication with the Emperor
and succor him in case of need. That
Napoleon expected Grouchy to do this is
shown by the orders which he gave to General
Marbot to throw out cavalry detachments in
that direction. On the morning of the fateful
18th the well-rested troops of Grouchy
might have marched at three. Yet they were
not ordered to move till six, and did not actually
get under way until about eight. When
the French of Grouchy left Gembloux for
Wavre, <em>the Prussians had already been four
hours on the desperate march to Waterloo</em>.</p>

<p>Having at length got his army off, the admirable
Grouchy rode as far as Walhain,
where he entered the house of a notary to
write a dispatch to the Emperor. Having
done this,—it was now about ten o’clock,—Marshal
Grouchy coolly sat down to his
breakfast. At this hour the Prussian advance
guard had reached St. Lambert, and
Wellington knew it. And here was Napoleon’s
lieutenant, placidly working his way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
those historic strawberries, blissfully ignorant
of the fact that his stupendous folly had
wrecked Napoleon’s last campaign.</p>

<p>Upon this breakfast enter the excited officers
who have heard the opening guns at Waterloo.
“A rearguard affair, no doubt,”
thinks the admirable Grouchy. But soon the
distant thunder and the cloud of smoke tell
of a battle, a great battle—a battle of which
men will talk as long as there are human
tongues to wag, as long as there are human
hearts to feel.</p>

<p>“The battle is at Mont-Saint-Jean,” says a
guide. And that is where the Emperor
thought the fight would be. “We must
march to the cannon,” says Gérard. So says
General Valezé. But Grouchy pleads his orders.
“If you will not go, allow me to go
with my corps and General Vallin’s cavalry,”
pleads Gérard. “No,” said Grouchy; “it
would be an unpardonable mistake to divide
my troops.” And he galloped away to amuse
himself with Thielman, as Blücher had meant
that he should do.</p>

<p>So, all day long, while the Emperor
strained his eyes to the right, looking, looking,
oh how longingly! for his own legions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
his own eagles, Grouchy was in a mere rearguard
engagement with Thielman.</p>

<p>When Bülow appeared like a sudden cloud
in the horizon, the Emperor hoped it was
Grouchy. When the cannonade at Wavre
reached La Belle Alliance, the Emperor
fancied that the sound drew nearer—that
Grouchy was coming, at last. The agony of
suspense which drew from Wellington the
famous “Blücher, or night,” could only have
been equalled by the storm which raged
within the Emperor’s breast—the storm of
impotent rage, and of regret that he had
leaned so heavy upon so frail a reed as
Grouchy.</p>

<p>The positive order which the Emperor
sent to Grouchy, after the appearance of
the Prussians at Chapelle-Saint-Lambert,
were delivered in time for a diversion in Bülow’s
rear which would have released Napoleon’s
right. But Grouchy decided that he
would obey this order <em>after</em> he had taken
Wavre. As he did not take Wavre until
nightfall, he might just as well have been
openly a traitor to his flag. During the
whole of two days he had been repeating
“my orders, my orders,” and his apologists
are forever prating about those orders; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
what about this last order, hot and direct,
from the field where all was at stake? How
could a victory over Thielman be anything
but a trivial affair in comparison with the tremendous
conflict going on over there at Mont-Saint-Jean?</p>

<p>Ah, well, he took Wavre, licked his Thielman,
extricated his army very cleverly from a
most perilous position made for it by the disaster
of Waterloo, got back into France in
admirable shape, and had the satisfaction of
knowing that he had made a record unique
in the history of the world.</p>

<p>As the man who did not do the thing he
was sent to do, Grouchy has no peer. As a
man who, in war, exemplified the adage of
“penny wise and pound foolish,” Grouchy is
unapproachable. As a man who,—by an almost
miraculous union of inertness, stupidity,
pig-headed obstinacy, complacent conceit,
jealous pride, and inopportune wilfulness,—caused
the last battle of the greatest soldier
of all time to become the synonym for unbounded
and irremediable disaster, Grouchy
occupies a lofty, lonely pillar of his own—a
sort of military Simeon Stylites.</p>

<p>WATERLOO</p>

<p>Why had the Emperor been so late in getting
into motion on the morning of the 16th?
Why had he not started at five o’clock, and
caught Zieten’s corps unsupported? Why
did he give Blücher time to concentrate?
Why did he not press the attack farther on
the evening of the day when the Prussians
were in full retreat? Why did he fail to give
Grouchy the customary order to pursue with
all the cavalry?</p>

<p>Satisfactory answers cannot be made.
That Napoleon’s conceptions were as grand
as ever is apparent, but his failure in matters
of detail is equally clear. Perhaps mental
and physical weariness after several hours of
sustained exertion and anxiety, furnish the
most plausible explanation of these errors.</p>

<p>At any rate, when he threw himself on his
bed at Fluerus on the night of the 16th, Napoleon
was worn out. Yet he did not know
the true state of the Prussian army, nor what
Ney had done at Quatre Bras. Soult sent no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
dispatches to Ney, and Ney sent none to
Soult.</p>

<p>The Emperor went to sleep <em>believing</em> but
not <em>knowing</em> that Blücher had been so badly
battered that it would take him at least two
days to gather together the remnant of his
army. More unfortunately still, Napoleon
believed that the Prussians had taken up a
line of retreat which would carry them beyond
supporting distance of the English.</p>

<p>To the contrary of both these convictions
of the Emperor, the bulk of the Prussian
army was preserving its formation, and
Gneisenau, acting for Blücher, who was believed
to be dead or a prisoner, had directed
the retreat on Wavre. Thus the Prussians
were keeping within supporting distance of
the English, although this was not Gneisenau’s
motive in issuing the order. He chose
Wavre for the reason that at Wavre the separated
corps of the army could best reunite.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The morning of the 17th of June dawns,
and Napoleon has Wellington in his power.
<em>But neither Wellington nor Napoleon knows
it.</em> The Duke does not know what has become
of the Prussians, and the Emperor does
not know that the English are where he and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
Ney, acting in concert, can utterly destroy
them.</p>

<p>It seems incredible that Ney sent no report
to Napoleon, and that the Emperor sent no
courier to Ney. But that is just the fact. It
was not until <em>after</em> Wellington had received
the report of the Prussian retreat, had realized
his peril, and was backing away from it,
that Napoleon awoke to a sense of the opportunity
which fortune had held for him all that
morning, while he lay supinely upon his bed,
or idly talked Parisian politics with his officers.</p>

<p>When he <em>did</em> realize what might have been,
he was ablaze with a fierce desire to make up
for lost time. Too late. Wellington was
already at a safe distance, in full retreat on
Brussels, and Ney had not molested him by
firing a single shot.</p>

<p>Soon the Emperor reached Quatre Bras,
but what could he do? True, he could dash
after the English cavalry and chase it as the
hunter chases the hare, but even the rearguard
of the enemy made good its escape.</p>

<p>They say that as the black storm cloud
spread over the heavens to the North the
hills behind were still bathed in sunlight, and
that as the English officer, Lord Uxbridge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
looked back, he saw a horseman suddenly
emerge from a dip in the road and appear on
the hill in front—and they knew it to be Napoleon,
leading the pursuit.</p>

<p>A battery galloped up, took position,
opened fire. And as it did so, the thunder
from the storm-cloud mingled with the thunder
of the guns, and the great rain of June
17th had begun to pour down.</p>

<p>“Gallop faster, men! For God’s sake,
gallop, or you will be taken!” It was Lord
Uxbridge speeding his flying cavalry.</p>

<p>After them streamed the French. Almost,
but not quite, the English were overtaken.
So close came the French that the English
heard their curses and jeers, just as Sir John
Moore’s retreating men heard them as they
took to their boats after the death-grapple at
Corunna.</p>

<p>Torrents of rain were pouring down. The
roads became bogs. Where the highways
passed between embankments each road was
a rushing stream. Horses mired to their
knees. Cannon carriages sank to the hubs.
The infantry was soaked with water and covered
with mud. The labor of getting forward
was exhausting to man and beast. But
the French pressed on until they reached the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
hills opposite the heights of Mont-Saint-Jean.
Upon those heights, and between the French
and Brussels, Wellington had come to a
stand.</p>

<p>A reconnaissance in force caused the English
to unmask, and Napoleon was happy.
The English army was before him. That he
would crush it on the morrow, he had not the
slightest doubt. He not only believed this,
but had good reason to believe it. Had not
the Prussians gone away to Namur, out of
supporting distance? Such was his firm conviction,
based partly on the knowledge of
what would be the natural course for the retreating
army to take, and partly on the report
of his scouts. Besides, had he not sent
Grouchy, Vandamme, and Gérard to take
care of Blücher?</p>

<p>Could the great soldier believe that his lieutenants,
trained in his own school by years of
service in the field, could manage so stupidly
as to allow the Prussians to take him in flank,
while he was giving battle to the English?</p>

<p>Regarding the vexed question as to whether
the order given to Grouchy was sufficient, a
civilian can but say that it would seem that
Grouchy ought to have known what was expected
of him even if he had not been specially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
instructed. The very size of the
army entrusted to him was enough to denote
its purpose. The fact that Napoleon was
going after Wellington and was sending
Grouchy after Blücher said as plainly as
words, “You take care of Blücher, while I
take care of Wellington.” By necessary implication,
the mere sending of Grouchy with
33,000 men after Blücher meant that
Grouchy’s mission was to keep the Prussians
off Napoleon while Napoleon was fighting
the English.</p>

<p>This was the common sense of it, and the
Emperor had every reason to believe that no
intelligent officer of his army could possibly
understand it otherwise.</p>

<p>Therefore, when he saw that Wellington
meant to give battle, he felt the stern joy of
the warrior who expects a fair fight and a
brilliant victory.</p>

<p>To Napoleon, a victory there meant even
more. It meant the possible end of arduous
warfare, an era of peace for France, the return
to his arms of his son, and the crowning
of his wonderful career by the continuation
and completion of that system of internal improvements
and beneficent institutions to
which Europe owes so much. Therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
when he plowed through the mud, drenched
with rain, and went the rounds of his army
posts, peering through the mists toward the
English lines, listening for any sound of an
army breaking camp to retreat, he was happy
to be convinced, “They mean to fight.”</p>

<p>No one could shake his belief that the Prussians
had gone off toward Namur. That they
had retired by a parallel line with the English
was incredible. That Blücher would appear
on the morrow, <em>and strike his flank
within two hours after the signal for battle
was fired</em>, was a thought which could not possibly
have been driven into Napoleon’s head.</p>

<p>In vain did his brother Jerome tell him of
what a servant of the inn had overheard the
English officers say, that very afternoon—that
Blücher was to come to their aid the next
day. Napoleon scouted the story. To his
dying day, it is doubtful whether he believed
that Wellington’s decision to stay and fight
was based upon the practical certainty that
Blücher would come to his aid. To that effect
Blücher had given his promise—and Wellington
knew that Blücher was not the man
to make his ally a false promise to induce
him to fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>Although Napoleon had slept but little on
Saturday night (the 17th) and had been out
in the rain and mud for hours making the
rounds of his outposts, a distance of two
miles, he seemed fresh and cheerful at
breakfast, and chatted freely with his officers.</p>

<p>There was a question of fixing the hour of
the attack. To give the ground time to become
drier and firmer under sun and wind,
hour after hour was suffered to pass. All
this while the more energetic Blücher was
plowing his way toward the field, over ground
just as wet. To a civilian it would seem if
the soil was firm enough to march on, it was
firm enough to fight on. If the Prussians
could drag their artillery through the defiles
of the Lasne, the French should have been
able to handle theirs in the valleys of Smohaine
and Braine-L’Alleud.</p>

<p>Therefore, it would seem to this writer
that on the morning of June 18th, when Napoleon
Bonaparte sat idly in his lines waiting
for sun and wind to harden the ground, he
had no one but himself to blame for giving
Blücher time to reach the field. During these
hours of waiting it appears singular that no
details of the plan of attack were discussed.
It seems strange that no preparations were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
made to cannonade the château of Hougoumont
and its outbuildings and walls. It
seems strange that no battery was planted to
shell the farmhouses of La Haye-Sainte. It
seems equally strange that nails and hammers
were not provided for the spiking of captured
cannon.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>One of the most horribly fascinating of
historical manuscripts is the warrant against
his enemies which Robespierre was signing
when Bourdon broke into the room and shot
him. There is the incomplete signature of
the erstwhile Dictator, and there are the
stains made by the blood which spurted from
his shattered jaw.</p>

<p>Even more profoundly interesting are a
few words written in pencil by Marshal Ney,
upon an order which Soult was about to send
to General D’Erlon: “Count D’Erlon will
understand that the action is to commence on
the left, not on the right. Communicate this
new arrangement to General Reilé.”</p>

<p>Why had the Emperor changed his mind?
At St. Helena, he appears not to have recalled
the fact that he changed his plan of battle
because Ney reported that a small stream,
which was on the line of advance to the right,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
had been swollen by the rains and it was impassable.</p>

<p>Stonewall Jackson was one of the many
military experts who studied the field of Waterloo,
and who said that the attack should
have been made on the right. It was there
that Wellington was weakest. Had the
French struck him there, Hougoumont
would have been worthless to him and would
not have cost such a frightful loss to the
French. But the Emperor, at the last moment,
changed his mind.</p>

<p>THE LAST BATTLE</p>

<p>“<em>Magnificent! Magnificent!</em>” exclaimed
Napoleon as he overlooked the legions that
were moving over the plateau, going into position.</p>

<p>Seated on his white mare, his gray dust-coat
covering all but the front of the green
uniform, on his head the small cocked hat of
the Brienne school, silver spurs on the riding-boots
which reached the knee, and at his side
the sword of Marengo—the great Captain
was never more radiant, never surer of success
than now.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Vive l’Empereur!</i> rolled in thunder tones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
as the troops marched before him. The
drum-beat was drowned in the mighty shout
of the legions as they went down into the
valley of the shadow of death. It was, on
the vastest scale, the old, old cry of the gladiators
as they trooped past the imperial box
to take their stations in the arena—“<em>Caesar!
we, who are about to die, salute you!</em>”</p>

<p>As the regiments passed in review, the
eagles were dipped to the Emperor, every
saber flashed in the sun, every bayonet
waved a hat or cap, every pennon was wildly
shaken, every band struck up the national air,
“<em>Let us watch over the safety of the Empire</em>”—and
over everything, drowning the
roll of the drums and the call of the bugles,
rose that frantic cry of frenzied devotion,
“<i lang="fr">Vive l’Empereur!</i>”</p>

<p>Napoleon’s eye dilated, his breast expanded
with pride—for the last time, the
very last time. Proud he had often been, and
in most instances he had won the right to be
so. On the heights of Rossomme and on the
plateau of La Belle Alliance, he was, this
Sunday morning, deservedly proud. He had
reconquered an empire without drawing the
sword, had almost done what Pompey had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
boasted that he could do—<em>called forth an
army by the stamp of his foot</em>; had smitten
his enemies and put them to rout, and now
while his lieutenant, on the right, would “cut
off the Prussians from Wellington,”—as
Grouchy had written that he would,—he, Napoleon,
would crush the English, and so win
back peace with honor.</p>

<p>A more magnificent army than that which
he proudly views has never been marshalled
for battle, for here are heroes whose record
reaches all the way back through Montmirail,
Dresden, Wagram, Jena, Borodino,
Austerlitz, Eylau and Friedland, to Marengo.</p>

<p>And Napoleon is proud, this last time.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In the field Napoleon had 74,000 men and
246 guns; Wellington had 67,000 men and
184 guns. But the British position was
strong. The hollow road of Ohain gave
them the benefit of its trench for 400 yards.
There were barricades of felled trees on the
Brussels and Nivelles roads. There was a
sand-pit which served as an intrenchment, and
the strong buildings and enclosure of Hougoumont,
La Haye-Sainte and Papelotte were
formidable defences.</p>

<p>Yet General Haxo, who was sent by Napoleon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
to inspect the enemy’s lines, reported
that he could not perceive any fortifications!</p>

<p>In addition to the hollow road, the natural
advantage of the position of the English was
that, from the crest which they were to defend,
the ground fell away so as to form a
declivity behind the crest, and along this hillside
the English were partially sheltered from
the French fire and altogether hidden from
view. From where he was, Napoleon could
not see more than half of Wellington’s army.
Another natural protection to the English
position were the tall, thick hedges, impassable
to the French cavalry.</p>

<p>All things considered, the attempt of the
Emperor to break the center of an English
army, so well posted as this, can be fairly
compared to Lee’s efforts to storm the heights
of Gettysburg. And in each case the attack
was made in ignorance of vitally important
facts.</p>

<p>Well might Napoleon afterward reproach
himself for not having reconnoitered the English
position.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>At thirty-five minutes past eleven the first
gun was fired.</p>

<p>Reillé had been ordered to occupy the approaches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
to Hougoumont, and had entrusted
the movement to Jerome Bonaparte. At the
head of the 1st Light Infantry he charged
the wood held by Nassau and Hanoverian
carbineers. An hour of furious fighting in
the dense thickets—in which General Bauduin
was killed—resulted in clearing the woods of
the enemy; but on getting clear of the thicket
the French found themselves coming upon the
strong walls and the large buildings of the
château.</p>

<p>Jerome had no orders to lead infantry
against a fortress like this, but he did it,
nevertheless. Wellington had thrown a garrison
into Hougoumont; the walls were loopholed
for musketry; and the French were led
to slaughter. It was impossible for infantry
to break these thick walls of solid masonry,
yet Jerome, in spite of the advice of his chief
of staff and the orders of his immediate
superior, Reillé, persisted until Hougoumont
had cost the lives of 1,600 Frenchmen and
had called away from the main battle nearly
11,000 men.</p>

<p>Why it was that the walls were not
breached with cannon before the infantry was
led against them can only be explained upon
the hypothesis that the Emperor never once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
thought his brother capable of so mad an undertaking.</p>

<p>It was nearly one o’clock when Napoleon
formed a battery of eighty guns and was
ready to make a great attack on the English
center. Before giving word to Ney, who was
to lead it, the Emperor carefully scanned the
entire battlefield through his glass.</p>

<p><em>What is that black cloud which has come
upon the distant horizon, there on the northeast?</em>
Every staff officer turns his glasses
to the heights of Chapelle-Saint-Lambert.
“Trees,” say some. But Napoleon knows
better. Those are troops. But whose? Are
they his? Is it Grouchy? Suppose it is the
advance guard of Blücher!</p>

<p>A hush, a chill falls upon the staff. A
cavalry squad is sent to reconnoiter; but before
it has even cleared itself of the French
lines, a prisoner taken by Marbot’s hussars is
brought to the Emperor. This prisoner was
the bearer of a letter from Bülow to Wellington
to announce the arrival of the Prussians!
Even now the Emperor does not realize his
danger, does not suspect the truth of the
situation, for he believes that Grouchy is so
maneuvering as to protect the French right
and to prevent the Prussians from falling on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
his flank. Napoleon sends him the dispatch:
“A letter which has just been intercepted tells
us that General Bülow is to attack our right
flank. We believe we can perceive the corps
on the heights of Chapelle-Saint-Lambert.
Therefore do not lose a minute to draw
nearer to us and to join us and crush Bülow,
whom you will catch in the very act.”</p>

<p>Immediately the Emperor detached the
cavalry divisions of Domon and Subervie to
the right to be ready to hold the Prussians in
check, and the 6th Corps (Lobau) was ordered
to move up behind this cavalry.</p>

<p><em>Thus from half-past one in the afternoon
Napoleon had two armies with which to deal.</em></p>

<p>Had he suspected that Blücher had left
Thielman’s corps to amuse Grouchy while the
bulk of the Prussian army was hastening to
join Bülow on the right flank of the French,
the Emperor would probably not have gone
deeper into this fight. Expecting every moment
to hear the roar of Grouchy’s guns in
Bülow’s rear, the Emperor now ordered Ney
to the grand attack on the English line.</p>

<p>Eighty cannon thundered against Mont-Saint-Jean,
and the English batteries roared
in reply. For half an hour the earth quivered
with the shock, and in Brussels, twenty miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
away, every living soul hung upon the roar of
the guns. Merchants closed their stores;
business of all sorts suspended; eager crowds
hurried to the Namur gate to listen, to question
stragglers from the front; timid travellers,
who had come in the train of Wellington’s
army, hastily secured conveyances and
fled by the Ghent road. In the churches,
women prayed.</p>

<p>Is Blücher the only man who could play the
game of leaving a part of his troops to detain
the enemy? Cannot Grouchy leave 10,000
men to die, if necessary, in holding Thielman,
while with the remainder he pushes for the
distant battlefield?</p>

<p>There are those who say he could not have
arrived in time had he made the effort. How
can anybody know that? Certainly his cavalry
could have covered the distance, and the
infantry in all probability would have arrived
in time to take the exhausted English in the
rear, after their advance to La Belle Alliance,
and cut the surprised troops to pieces.</p>

<p>Thus while the Prussians were chasing
Napoleon, Grouchy would have been chasing
Wellington, with the net result that the Prussians,
within a few days, would have been
caught between Napoleon’s rallied troops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
and the victorious army of Grouchy. But it
was not to be so. Grouchy did precisely what
Blücher wanted him to do—spent the golden
hours with Thielman at Wavre.</p>

<p>After the cannonade of half an hour, Ney
and D’Erlon led the grand attack on the
English position. And a worse managed affair
it would be difficult to imagine. Instead
of forming columns of attack, admitting of
easy and rapid deployment, the troops were
massed in compact phalanxes, with a front of
166 to 200 files, with a depth of twenty-four
men. The destruction which canister causes
on dense masses like these, exposed in the
open field, is something horrible to contemplate.
The error was so glaring that one of
the division commanders, Durutte, flatly refused
to allow his men to be formed in that
way.</p>

<p>Where was the eagle glance of Napoleon
that he did not detect the faulty formation
which Ney and D’Erlon were making? Is
such a detail beneath the notice of a commander-in-chief?</p>

<p>If the Emperor saw the mistake he gave no
sign, and the troops of D’Erlon, ashamed of
not having been in the fights of the 16th,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
rushed into the valley shouting, “<i lang="fr">Vive l’Empereur!</i>”</p>

<p>“Into the jaws of death” they marched, for
as they crossed the valley and mounted the
slopes beyond, the English batteries cut long
lanes through their deep, dense lines and they
fell by the hundreds.</p>

<p>A part of the attacking force was thrown
against the walls and buildings of La Haye-Sainte,
and here, as at Hougoumont, infantry
were slaughtered from behind unbreached
walls. But the great charge against the English
position went on heedless of such detail
as the attack on La Haye-Sainte. Through
the rye, which was breast-high, and over
ground into which they mired at every step,
the columns of D’Erlon pressed upward, crying
“<i lang="fr">Vive l’Empereur!</i>”</p>

<p>The defenders of the sand pit were driven
out and thrown beyond the hedges. The
Netherlanders and Dutch broke, and in their
flight behind the hedges disordered the ranks
of an English regiment. The Nassau troops,
which held the Papelotte farm, were dislodged
by the French under Durutte, and the
great charge seemed to be on the point of succeeding.
But the faulty formation of the attacking
columns ruined all. When the attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
was made to deploy, so much time was
consumed that the English gunners had only
to fire at the dense mass of men to litter the
earth with the wounded and the dead. The
carnage was frightful.</p>

<p>Picton, the English general, seeing the efforts
of the French to deploy, seized the opportunity,
led a brigade against the French
column, delivered a volley, and then ordered
a bayonet charge. Pouring from behind the
hedges, the English rushed upon the confused
mass of French, and a terrible fight at
close quarters took place. It was here that
Picton was killed.</p>

<p>While the column of Donzelot was engaged
in this desperate struggle, the column
of Marcognet had broken through the hedges
and was advancing to take a battery. But as
the French shouted “Victory,” the sound of
the bag-pipes was heard, and the Highlanders
opened fire. Owing to their faulty formation,
the French could only reply by a volley from
the front line of a single battalion. Their
only hope was to charge with the bayonet.
While desperately engaged with the Scotch
troops, Lord Uxbridge dashed upon them
with his cavalry.</p>

<p>The issue could not be doubtful. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
French could not deploy; the confused mass
could not defend itself against infantry or
cavalry. They were raked by cannon shot,
and by musketry, and the English cavalry
hacked them to pieces. The slaughter was
pitiable and was mainly due to a formation
which gave these brave men no chance to
fight.</p>

<p>In their exultation the English carried their
charges too far. The Scotch Greys, indeed,
dashed up the slope upon which the French
were posted, captured the division of batteries
of Durutte and attempted to carry the main
battery. Napoleon himself ordered the
countercharge which swept the English cavalry
beyond La Haye-Sainte.</p>

<p>All this while, Jerome Bonaparte was still
assaulting Hougoumont. Defenders and
assailants had each been reinforced. The
Emperor ordered a battery of howitzers to
shell the buildings. Fire broke out, and the
château and its outbuildings were consumed.
The English threw themselves into the
chapel, the barn, the farmer’s house, a sunken
road, and continued to hold the position.</p>

<p>It was now half-past three o’clock. Wellington
and Napoleon were both becoming
uneasy—the former because Blücher’s troops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
were not yet in line, the latter because he had
begun to doubt that Grouchy would come.
The Emperor ordered Ney to make another
attack on La Haye-Sainte. The English,
from behind hedges of the Ohain road, repulsed
it.</p>

<p>While the movement was being made the
main French battery of eighty guns cannonaded
the English right center. “Never had
the oldest soldiers heard such a cannonade,”
said General Alten.</p>

<p>The English line moved back a short distance
so as to get the protection of the edge
of the plateau. Ney, mistaking this movement,
ordered a cavalry charge. At first he
meant to use a brigade only, but owing to
some misunderstanding that cannot be cleared
up, this intended charge of a brigade drew
into it practically all the cavalry of the French
army. Napoleon himself did not see what
was happening. From his position near the
“Maison Decoster” inn, Napoleon did not
have a view of the ground in which the cavalry
divisions were forming for this premature
disastrous attack.</p>

<p>The English saw it all, and were glad to
see it. What better could they ask? Their
lines had not been disordered by artillery or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
by infantry; what had they to fear from cavalry?
Nothing. They sprang up, formed
squares and waited. The English gunners,
whose batteries were in front, were ordered
to reserve their fire till the last moment, and
then to take shelter within the squares.</p>

<p>As the French advanced, they were exposed
to the full fury of the English batteries.
The slope up which the cavalry rode is not
steep, but the tall grain and the deep mud
made it extremely difficult.</p>

<p>Yet this magnificent body of horse, in spite
of dreadful losses, drove the gunners from
the batteries and took the guns!</p>

<p>But they had nothing to spike them with,
they could not drag them away, they did not
even break the cannon sponges.</p>

<p>Therefore when they found that the English
infantry was not in disorder, but in
squares upon whose walls of steel no impression
could be made; when they fell into confusion
because of their own numbers crowded
in so small a space, when Uxbridge’s five
thousand fresh horses were hurled upon the
jaded French, and they fell back before the
shock, the English gunners had but to run
back to their guns and renew the murderous
cannonade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>Yet no sooner had the wonderful soldiers
of Milhaud and Lefebre-Desnoette reached
the bottom of the valley than they charged up
the muddy slopes again. Once more they
drove in the cannoneers: once more they
carried the heights, and fell upon the English
squares. At this moment some of the English
officers believed that the battle was lost.
But Napoleon watched the cavalry charge
with uneasiness and called it “premature.”
Soult declared that “Ney is compromising us
as he did at Jena.”</p>

<p>The Emperor said, “This has taken place
an hour too soon, but we must stand by what
is already done.” Then he sent to Kellerman
and Guyot an order to charge. This carried
into action the remaining cavalry. It
was now after five o’clock.</p>

<p>In a space which offered room for the deployment
of only one thousand, eight or nine
thousand French cavalry went to fight unbroken
infantry!</p>

<p>A storm of cannon balls broke upon these
dense masses, and the slaughter was terrific,
but nothing stopped the French. Again they
swept past the guns, again they assaulted the
squares, time and again and again—while an
enfilading fire emptied saddles by the hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
at every volley. Some of the squares were
broken, an English flag was captured, the
German Legion lost its colors, the French
horse rode through the English line, to be destroyed
by the batteries in reserve. Wellington
had taken refuge within a square, but he
now came out and ordered a charge of his
cavalry. For the third time the French were
driven off the plateau.</p>

<p>Yet Ney, losing his head completely, led
another cavalry charge! Again ran the gunners
away from the batteries, and again the
cavalry broke on the squares. In fact, the
wounded and dead were piled so high in front
of the squares that each had a hideous breastwork
before it which made it almost impossible
for the French to reach the English.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the Emperor had decided to
support Ney in his cavalry charges, it seems
strange that neither he nor Ney used the infantry.</p>

<p>The 6,000 men of the Bachelu and Foy
division were close by, watching the cavalry
charges and eager to support them. As Ney
was personally leading the cavalry, it is easy
to understand how he came to forget everything
else; but the Emperor’s failure to send
in this infantry is not readily understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>Only after the fourth charge of the cavalry
had been repulsed, did Ney call in the infantry.
But he was too late; the English
batteries tore this closely packed body of men
to shreds, and in a few minutes 1,500 had
fallen and the column was in retreat.</p>

<p>It was now six o’clock. La Haye-Sainte
was at length taken, with great loss of life on
both sides. From this point of vantage Ney
assailed the English lines. The sand pit was
again abandoned by the enemy, and Ney used
this and a mound near La Haye-Sainte to
pour a destructive fire upon the center of Wellington’s
line. The French infantry charged,
drove the English, captured a flag, and there
was now a gap in the very center of the English
line. Wellington was in a critical condition,
and had the Old Guard charged <em>then</em>,
neither Blücher nor night might have come
in time.</p>

<p>Ney saw the opportunity and sent to the
Emperor for a few infantry to complete the
work. “Troops?” exclaimed Napoleon to
the officer who brought Ney’s message.
“Where do you expect me to get them? Do
you expect me to make them?”</p>

<p>At the same moment, one of Wellington’s
lieutenants sent for reinforcements. “There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
are none,” he said. Suppose that at this
moment Napoleon could have hurled on the
English line the 16,000 men who were holding
back the Prussians!</p>

<p>Yet the fact is that the Emperor had in
hand fourteen battalions which had not been
engaged, and what amazes the civilian is that,
after refusing to take advantage of the impression
Ney had made upon the enemy’s line,
Napoleon organized another general advance
against Mont-Saint-Jean an hour later.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Ever since two o’clock the Prussians had
been operating on the French right wing.
Bülow’s corps was having a bloody struggle
with Lobau and the Young Guard. Time
and again the Prussians were thrown back;
time and again they returned to the attack.
At the instant when Ney was demanding more
troops, Lobau’s corps was in retreat and the
Young Guard was driven out of Plancenoit.
Napoleon’s own position on La Belle Alliance
was threatened. To prevent the Prussians
from coming upon his rear, the Emperor sent
in eleven battalions of the Old Guard which,
with fixed bayonets and without firing a shot,
drove the Prussians out of Plancenoit and
chased them six hundred yards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>It was now after seven o’clock. There
were still two hours of daylight. In the distance
were heard the guns of Grouchy; the
sound seemed to draw nearer. The Emperor,
counting too much on Grouchy always, believed
that at last his tardy lieutenant was engaged
with the bulk of the Prussian army,
and that he himself would have to deal with
the corps of Bülow only.</p>

<p>The Emperor swept the field of battle with
his glass. On the right, Durutte’s division
held Papelotte and La Haye and was advancing
up the slope toward the English line. On
the left, Jerome had stormed the burning
château of Hougoumont, and the Lancers
had crossed the Nivelles road. In the center,
and above La Haye-Sainte, the French were
driving the enemy along the Ohain road.
The valley was crowded with the wrecks of
broken French regiments.</p>

<p>Placing himself at the head of nine battalions
of the Old Guard, Napoleon led it down
into the valley, spoke to his men briefly, and
launched them against the enemy. It was
too late. A deserter had given Wellington full
notice of the preparations for the attack and
he had thrown reinforcements into the weak
portions of his line. The arrival of Zeiten’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
Prussians relieved the flanking squadrons of
Vivian and Vandeleur, and Wellington now
had 2,600 fresh horsemen to throw into the
fight.</p>

<p>At full gallop, the Prussian Commissioner
to the Allies, Muffling, rode to Zeiten, exclaiming,
“The battle is lost if you do not go
to the Duke’s rescue.”</p>

<p>On came the Prussians, striking the French
flank from Smohain, and in spite of all the
personal exertions of the Emperor, a panic
spread throughout that part of his army.</p>

<p>Couriers had been sent all along the line
to tell the French that Grouchy was approaching.
Yet the battle on the right where
Lobau and the Young Guard were struggling
to keep Bülow back must have been known
to thousands of the troops. Then, when
they actually saw the Prussians taking them
in flank, all their fears of treachery were intensified
and they were filled with terror.</p>

<p>But the Emperor had raised his arm to
strike the enemy one final blow and he could
not stay his hand. Even had he tried to recall
Ney, D’Erlon, Reillé, it is doubtful
whether the situation would have been improved.
There was so much confusion, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
many shattered commands, that an orderly
retreat had become impossible.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the report that Grouchy
had come, the charging columns shouted
“<i lang="fr">Vive l’Empereur!</i>” and passed on.</p>

<p>Freeing himself from the fifth horse which
had been shot under him that day, the dauntless
Ney went forward on foot, sword in
hand. Losing terribly at every step, the
French advanced up the slope. They took
some batteries, they almost gained the Crest;
but suddenly Maitland’s Guards, 2,000
strong, sprang up out of the wheat where they
had been lying concealed, and poured a deadly
volley into the French. Why was there no
officer with presence of mind enough to cry
then, “<em>Give them the bayonet</em>”? That was
the one hope of the French. Instead of doing
this, the officers tried to place the men in
line so as to exchange volleys with the enemy.
Fatal mistake. Wellington, noting the confusion
and the hesitation, took advantage of
it like a good soldier.</p>

<p>“Up, Guards, and at ’em!” cried the Duke.</p>

<p>“Forward, boys, now is your time!” cried
Colonel Saltoun.</p>

<p>The French, fighting frantically, were beaten
back to the orchard of Hougoumont.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<p>Here a fresh battalion (4th Chasseurs)
came to the relief of the retreating French,
and the English returned rapidly to their own
lines.</p>

<p>Once more the Old Guard moves up the
muddy slope, under the tremendous cannonade
of the English guns. As they cross the
Ohain road, an English brigade opens four
lines of fire upon their flank; Maitland’s
Guards and Halkett’s brigade oppose them
in front; and a Hanoverian brigade, coming
from the hedges of Hougoumont, fire upon
them from the rear. The finishing blow is
Colborn’s charge with fixed bayonets.</p>

<p>“The guard gives way!” rings over the
battlefield—a wail of despair, of terror.</p>

<p>“Treachery!” is the cry throughout the
field.</p>

<p>Now is the time to make an end of this
panic-stricken army, and Wellington, spurring
to the crest, waves his hat—the signal for an
advance all along the line.</p>

<p>As night closes in, the English army,
40,000 strong, rush down the bloody, corpse-strewn
slope, trampling the wounded and the
dead, crying, “No Quarter!”</p>

<p>The drum, the bugle, the bagpipe quicken
the march of the English and the flight of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
French. Making no stand at La Haye-Sainte,
none at Hougoumont, none anywhere,
the French army, already honeycombed with
suspicion, dissolves in terror. Never had so
strong a war-weapon shown itself so brittle.</p>

<p>Napoleon was at La Haye-Sainte, forming
another column of attack which he meant to
lead in person, when he looked up and saw
the Old Guard falter and stop.</p>

<p>“They are confused. All is lost!” Hoping
to stem the tide of the English advance
and to establish rallying points for his flying
troops, he formed four squares from a column
of the Old Guard which had not been engaged.
These he posted above La Haye-Sainte.
As the English horsemen came on, they
dashed in vain against these walls of steel
and fire. But nothing so frail as four squares
could arrest the advance of 40,000 men.
The English cavalry poured through the gaps
which separated the squares and continued
their headlong pursuit of the terrified French.</p>

<p>When the English infantry came up and
raked the squares with musketry; when the
English batteries began to hail grapeshot upon
them, the Emperor gave the order to abandon
the position. Attended by a small escort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
he galloped to the height of La Belle
Alliance.</p>

<p>The three squares fell back, slowly, steadily,
surrounded on all sides by the enemy.
With the regularity of the paradeground
these matchless soldiers of the Old Guard
halted to fire, to reform their ranks, and then
move on again.</p>

<p>“Fugitives from the battlefield looked back
from the distance and marked the progress of
the retreat by the regular flash of these guns.”
On that black valley of death and vast misfortune
it was the repeated flashes of lightning
irradiating a stormcloud.</p>

<p>Filled with admiration and sympathy, let
us hope, an English officer cried out, “Surrender!”</p>

<p>And Cambronne shot out the word which
Victor Hugo indecently glorified, but which
with convincing emphasis spurned the very
thought of surrender. The squares, unbroken,
reached the summit of La Belle Alliance,
where Cambronne fell, apparently dead, from
a ball which struck him in the face.</p>

<p>It was here that the Prussians, who had at
last broken in on the right, bore down on the
squares. Assailed by overwhelming odds—infantry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
artillery, cavalry—they were destroyed.</p>

<p>Several hundred yards back there were
two battalions of the Old Guard, formed in
squares. Within one of these squares was
the Emperor. Planting a battery of 12-pounders,
he made a final effort to check the
pursuit and to rally his troops. The Guard’s
call to arms was sounded, but the fugitives
continued to pour by and none rallied. The
battery exhausted its ammunition and the gunners,
refusing to fly, were cut down by the
English hussars.</p>

<p>Upon the squares themselves the enemy
could make no impression until overpowering
masses of Prussian and English infantry
came up. Then the Emperor ordered a retreat.
In good order these veterans marched
off the field, stopping from time to time to
fire a volley upon their pursuers.</p>

<p>At the farm of Le Caillou the battalion
formed in column, and on its flank slowly
rode the Emperor, reeling with fatigue, so
that he had to be supported in the saddle.
His bridle reins were loose upon his horse’s
neck.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p>As the moon came out that night, her cold
face was hateful to the fleeing French, for it
lit the roads for the merciless pursuers.</p>

<p>The exhausted English had halted at La
Belle Alliance.</p>

<p>The Prussians came thundering on, and
the two victors, Wellington and Blücher, embraced.
Each called the other the winner of
the day. Justly so—for each <em>was</em> the winner.
To success both had been necessary.</p>

<p>The Prussians had made a most fatiguing
march in the morning, and had fought with
desperation for many hours, but they alone
had strength left for the pursuit. Wellington’s
troops fell down among the dying and
the dead, to rest and sleep. But not until
they had cheered the Prussians passing by.
“Hip, hip, hurrah!” shout the English, while
the bands play.</p>

<p>The Prussians go by, singing Luther’s
hymn, “Now praise we all our God.”</p>

<p>And then these devout Christians hot-foot
upon the track of other Christians, hurry on
to a moonlight hunt—vast, terrible, murderous.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
These Prussians remember the pursuit
after Jena; yes, and the pursuit after Austerlitz;
yes, and the long years of French
military occupation of the Fatherland. And
now it is their turn.</p>

<p>“As long as man and horse can go—push
the pursuit!” cried Blücher.</p>

<p>Not a great many Prussians are needed.
A few cannon to make a noise, a few bugles
to sound the charge, a few drums to send
terror ahead—these, with about 4,500
troops, will be quite sufficient to chase Napoleon’s
army like a flock of sheep.</p>

<p>Forty thousand Frenchmen, unwounded, as
brave a lot of men as ever stepped into line,
are now so crushed by unexpected disaster, so
filled with the terror of sheer panic, that no
human power can check their stampede.</p>

<p>Ney has tried it, vainly. Napoleon has
tried it, vainly. They abandon the artillery,
they throw away their guns, they cast off their
accouterments, intent only on running for
dear life. They cut through the fields, they
fight for passage on the road, they murder
one another in their frantic efforts to get on.</p>

<p>The Prussians chase them, cut them down,
ride over them—the roads, the fields, the
woods are strewn with slaughtered Frenchmen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
If any stand is made and a few of the
firmer rally, the first blare of Prussian trumpets
sets them running again. The 4,500
Prussians dwindle, as the chase lengthens, until
scarcely a thousand pursue. But the
French have lost their senses. The mere
blare of a Prussian bugle throws them into
agonies of fright. One drummer-boy, galloping
on horseback, a dozen cavalrymen to
yell the Prussian “Hourra!” are enough to
keep the stampede going.</p>

<p>“No quarter!” cry the pursuers. Yet after
Ligny Napoleon had gone, in person, to
take care of the Prussian wounded, and had
threatened the Belgian peasants with the terrors
of hell if they did not succor these sufferers.
“God bids us love our enemies,” said
the Emperor to these peasants. “Take care
of the wounded, or God will make you burn.”
But the English had cried “No quarter!” as
they charged down from Mont-Saint-Jean,
and now the Prussians are repeating the cry
and slaughtering, with indiscriminate fury,
those who surrender, those who are wounded
and those who are overtaken.</p>

<p>So mad is the panic of the French that at
Gemappe, where the little river Dyle is only
about fifteen feet wide and three feet deep,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
they have a frightful crush at the narrow
bridge and never once think of wading across.</p>

<p>Here, once more Napoleon vainly endeavors
to stop the rout. The Prussians appear,
beat the drum, blow the trumpets, fire cannon,
and the thousands of Frenchmen fight
madly with each other for the privilege
of running away. They slash each other
with their swords, stab each other with their
bayonets, and even shoot each other down.</p>

<p>To appreciate the state of mind of this
fleeing army it is necessary that one should
have a good idea of what happens to the
crowd in a packed theater when the red
tongues of the flames are seen in the hangings
and the cry of “<em>Fire! Fire!</em>” smites the startled
ear. The horrible scene which invariably
follows is the outcome of exactly the uncontrollable,
unreasoning terror which made the
flight from Napoleon’s last battlefield such a
disgrace to human nature.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The moon which held a light for the pursuit
silvered also the slopes where the great
battle had been fought, shone upon the unburied
corpses that still lay at Ligny and
Quatre Bras, shone upon 25,000 Frenchmen,
6,000 Prussians, and 10,000 of the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
army, who lay on the field of Waterloo; shone
also upon other thousands who lay dead or
dying on the futile battle-ground of Wavre.
Within three days and within the narrow
radius of a few miles more than 70,000 men
had been shot down—for what?</p>

<p>For what? To force upon the French a
King and a system which they detested, and
to prevent the spread of democratic principles
to other countries where kings and aristocracies
were in power.</p>

<p>Creasy numbers Waterloo among the
Twelve Decisive Battles of the World, but
it does not deserve the rank. It did not give
democratic principles anything more than a
temporary set-back. It did not permanently
restore the Bourbons. It did not even keep
the Bonaparte heir off the throne. Much
less did it settle the principle that one nation
may dictate to another its form of government.</p>

<p>In his old age, Wellington was asked to
write his Memoirs. “No,” he answered.
“It wouldn’t do. If I were to tell what I
know, the people would tear me to pieces.”</p>

<p>I think I understand. If the ruling oligarchs
of England,—Eldon, Castlereagh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
Pitt, Canning, Liverpool, Bathurst,—had
revealed the inner secrets of the Tory administration,
the last one of them would have
been torn to pieces—deservedly.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The man-hunt rolls off toward the Sambre,
the drum dies away in the distance, the horror
of the retreat goes farther and farther away,—while
the moon looks down upon the English
army, asleep on La Belle Alliance, upon
the blood-stained valleys and slopes that lead
to Mont-Saint-Jean, upon the smouldering
ruins of Hougoumont, of La Haye-Sainte, of
Papelotte, of Plancenoit. There are dead men
everywhere. Everywhere are dying men,
dismounted cannons, broken swords, abandoned
guns and knapsacks, dead horses, and
mangled horses that scream as they struggle
with pain and death, wounded men who moan
and groan and curse their fate.</p>

<p>A mile wide and two miles long, this strip
of hell writhes beneath the unpitying stars;
and perhaps the most awful sound that shocks
the ear and the soul is that choked yell of terror
and agony of the officer who is being
clubbed to death with a musket by the night
prowler who wants the officer’s watch, decorations

<p>Enter the ground of the Château of Hougoumont,
pass the shattered buildings and go
into the flower garden. Here was once the
beauty of nature and the beauty of art, combined.
This morning, when the sun broke
through the mists, these formal walks were
bordered by the bloom of flowers; these
balustraded terraces were fragrant with the
incense of the orange and the myrtle. The
birds were singing in the garden overhead,
along these quiet covered walks in the old
Flemish garden, vine clad with honey-suckle
and jessamine, where many a word of love
had been spoken as lovers wandered here in
years long past.</p>

<p>And now it is one of the frightful spots
of the world, reeking with blood, cumbered
with dead and dying men, torn by shells, gutted
by fire. The well is ever so deep and ever
so large, but is never so deep nor so large as
to hold all the dead and the dying. To-morrow
it will be filled. The dauntless defenders
and the fearless assailants will embrace
in the harmony of a common grave.
And for many and many a year the peasant
at his fireside at night will tell, in hushed
tones, of the sounds—the groans, the faint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
calls for help—which are said to have been
heard coming from the well, nights after its
hasty filling in.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Few partisans of Napoleon now contend
that he was free from serious fault in this,
his last campaign.</p>

<p>First of all, he should have made his appeal
to the people, put himself once more at their
head as the hero of the French Revolution,
remained in France, and nationalized the
war.</p>

<p>Again, he should not have placed two such
generals as Vandamme and Gérard under
Grouchy.</p>

<p>He showed no vigor in following up his
victory at Ligny, and made a capital error in
not breaking up the retreating foe with cavalry
charges.</p>

<p>He lost a great opportunity at Quatre
Bras.</p>

<p>On the night of the 17th he should have
sent definite orders to Grouchy, and should
have hearkened to Soult when he was urged
by that thorough soldier to call in at least a
portion of Grouchy’s force.</p>

<p>He took the reports of Haxo and Ney, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
based the battle upon their erroneous reports.
The Napoleon of earlier years would have
<em>gone to see for himself</em>.</p>

<p>He did not have a good view of the field
and consequently missed detailed movements
of immense importance.</p>

<p>He treated with too much scorn the opinion
of Soult and Reillé (who had tested the English
soldier in Spain), when they warned him
that the English, properly posted and properly
handled—as Wellington could handle them—were
invincible.</p>

<p>He made the attack without maneuvering,
in just the bare-breasted, full-face way that
best lent itself to bloody repulse.</p>

<p>The premature cavalry movement which
contributed most to the final disaster was under
full headway,—too far advanced to be
stopped,—before he knew that it was contemplated.</p>

<p>In holding off the Prussians, the Emperor
displayed his genius, directing every movement
himself. On the field of Waterloo, he
left too much to Ney and Jerome. Had he
taken Ney out of the fight at the time that he
recalled Jerome, the issue might have been
different.</p>

<p>The last grand charge should not have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
made at all. He should have stopped, as
Lee did at Gettysburg, in time to save his
army, for by this time he <em>knew</em> that Grouchy
would not come. To stake so much on one
last desperate throw was the act of a man
who was no longer what he had been at Aspern
and Essling when he withdrew into the
Island of Lobau.</p>

<p>When the Emperor was giving the order
for the last great charge, General Haxo
would have remonstrated. “But, Sire—” he
began. Napoleon flapped his glove lightly
across Haxo’s face and said, “Hold your
tongue, my friend. There is Grouchy who
will give us other news.” He had mistaken
Bülow’s cannonade for Grouchy’s.</p>

<p>One can understand what was passing in
his mind when he said to Gourgaud, a few
weeks later, “Ah, if it were to be done over
again!”</p>

<p>On Wellington’s side the management was
superb. It was practically faultless. He
made the most of every advantage, and made
the most of the errors of his enemy.</p>

<p>With this exception: He left 18,000 of
his men at Hal, four or five miles away, protecting
a road which he feared the French
might take. But with Napoleon facing him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
here at Mont-Saint-Jean, the 18,000 men
were no longer needed at Hal; and no one has
ever been able to explain why Wellington did
not call them in during the early morning of
the 18th.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In other books than this you will read of
how the wreck of Napoleon, the man, and the
wreck of Napoleon, the Emperor, found their
way to Paris; how the well-meaning but
weak-headed La Fayette, dreaming of an impossible
Republic, worked in reality for the
Bourbon restoration in working against Napoleon;
how the Chambers, honeycombed by
the intrigues of Fouché, demanded the second
abdication; how the wreck of Napoleon
floated aimlessly down the current of misfortune;
how he signed away his throne; how
the masses thronged about his palace, wildly
clamoring for him to put himself at the head
of a national uprising; how he sends his
empty coach and six through the mob, and
makes off by the back way in a cab; how he
stops at Malmaison, weeps for his lost Josephine,
listens to all kinds of counsel, takes
none, and has no plan; how the soldiers,
marching past in straggling detachments,
cheer him with the same old enthusiasm, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
how he calmly remarks, “They had better
have stood and fought at Waterloo.”</p>

<p>Napoleon was no longer the volcanic man
of action, of connected ideas, of sustained
exertion, of inflexible purpose. The Waterloo
campaign had been a sputtering of the
candle in the socket—a brief eruption of a
Vesuvius that made Europe quiver; and then
all was over.</p>

<p>From Malmaison he is ordered off by
Fouché, and he meekly obeys. At Rochefort
he dawdles, doubts, delays, and does nothing.
Logically, he becomes a prisoner to those by
whom he has been beaten.</p>

<p>To St. Helena, and a few years of torture;
to hopeless captivity and the bitter inbrooding
that eat the heart out; to the depths of humiliation
and the canker of impotent rage;
to weary days of depression and dreary nights
of pain; to a long agony of vain regrets, of
wrath against fate, of soul-racking memories—to
these go Napoleon Bonaparte, the
greatest man ever born of woman.</p>

<p>At last, the reprieve comes. At last there
comes the day when the little man can no
longer torture the big one. Sir Hudson Lowe
may at length rest easy—the sweat of the
final pain gathers on his captive’s brow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
English sentinels may slacken their vigilance
now—the death rattle is in the prisoner’s
throat.</p>

<p>The storm comes up from out the wrathful
sea, and the terrible anger of the tempest
beats upon the tropical rock. The thunder,
peal on peal, volleys over the crags, and the
glare of the lightning lights up the track of
devastation. Within the renovated cow-house,
and within a room which will soon be
used again as a cow-stall, is stretched the
dying warrior.</p>

<p>What was it that the storm said to the unconscious
soldier? By what mysterious law,
yet to be made plain, does the sub-consciousness
move and speak when deep sleep or the
delirium of disease has paralyzed the normal
consciousness of man? We do not know.
In poetry, the sub-conscious produces the
weird “Kubla Khan”; in music it notates
“The Devil’s Sonata.” It is the sub-conscious
which often gives warning of evil to
come; it is the sub-conscious that sometimes
tells us the right road when all is doubt.</p>

<p>As the thunder volleyed over Longwood,
and the roar of the storm held on, the dying
Captain was strangely affected. Just such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
thunder had rolled over his head that Saturday
night and Sunday morning, when he went
the rounds of his outposts in the drenching
rain—which may have been the main cause
of his loss of Waterloo. He and the faithful
Bertrand had made those night-rounds alone,
and Napoleon, as he stopped to listen to the
thunder, muttered, “We agree.”</p>

<p>It must have been that in his delirium he
fancied he was again on the front line, listening
to the storm which preceded his last battle.</p>

<p>“The Army! The head of the Army!” he
muttered. “Desaix! Bessiéres! Hasten
the attack! Press on! The enemy gives
way—they are ours!”</p>

<p>With a convulsive start he sprang up, out
of the bed, and got upon his feet. Montholon
seized him, but he bore the Count to the
floor. Others rushed in; he was already
exhausted, and they put him back in bed.
Afterward he lay still, and the boat drifted
on, quietly on, toward the bar.</p>

<p>The storm had passed away, and the Emperor,
lying on his back, with one hand out
of the bed, fixed his eyes “as though in deep
meditation.”</p>

<p>Those about the bed thought they heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
him say, “France! Josephine!” Then he
spoke no more.</p>

<p>A light foam gathered on the parted lips.
There was peace on his face—for the pain
had done what it came to do.</p>

<p>As the clear sun dipped beneath the distant
rim of the sea, Napoleon died.</p>

<p>It was May 5th, 1821.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In Hillaire Belloc’s magnificent study of
Danton, the author makes reference to a legend
which is said to be current among the
peasants of Russia.</p>

<p>It is a story of “a certain somber, mounted
figure, unreal, only an outline and a cloud,
that passed away to Asia, to the East and
North. They saw him move along their
snows through the long, mysterious twilight
of the Northern autumn, in silence, with the
head bent and the reins in the left hand, loose,
following some enduring purpose, reaching toward
an ancient solitude and repose. <em>They
say that it was Napoleon.</em> After him, there
trailed for days the shadows of the soldiery,
vague mists bearing faintly the forms of companies
of men. It was as though the cannon-smoke
of Waterloo, borne on the light west
wind of that June day, had received the spirits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
of twenty years of combat, and had drifted
farther and farther during the fall of the year
over the endless plains.</p>

<p>“But there was no voice and no order.
The terrible tramp of the Guard and the
sound that Heine loved, the dance of the
French drums, was extinguished; there was
no echo of their songs, for the army was of
ghosts and was defeated. They passed in the
silence which we can never pierce, and somewhere
remote from men they sleep in bivouac
round the most splendid of human swords.”</p>

</div>

<h3>BLÜCHER</h3>

<p>“Captain Blücher has full permission to
resign, and to go to the devil, if he likes.”</p>

<p>Thus endorsed by Frederick the Great,
Captain Blücher’s written request for leave
to retire from the Prussian Army went into
effect.</p>

<p>Yet this headstrong, boisterous, hard-drinking,
hard-riding, hard-fighting, indefatigable
Blücher became one of the most thorough
and effective soldiers that ever led an
army to battle. He possessed some of those
very qualities which made Washington,
Cromwell, and Frederick so great. He was
tireless, he was iron-willed, he was true-hearted,
he was fearless, he was not to be discouraged,
and he never could be whipped so
badly that he did not come back to fight again,
harder than ever.</p>

<p>Something of a national hero, something of
a typical German soldier, something of an
ideal patriot, he was something of a ruthless
Goth. He had gone to England after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
Campaign of Paris, in 1814, and rode conspicuously
in the great procession through
London. As he looked upon the wealth displayed
on every side, he growled, “What a
town to sack.” Yet he was a devoted husband,
a most loyal subject; a generous, faithful,
daring ally.</p>

<p>He had fought against the French a
greater number of times than any other commander.
He had been whipped oftener and
harder than any other commander. He had
been captured, and had grazed annihilation
oftener than any other commander.</p>

<p>After Jena, his king owed his escape from
being made prisoner to a bold falsehood—to
General Klein—that an armistice had been declared.
At Bautzen he just did get out of the
trap Napoleon laid for him, and he did it
because Ney, in making the turning movement,
stopped to do some fighting which gave
the Prussian his warning. In 1814 he just
did miss being bagged time and again—but
he missed it. And now in 1815 his pluck,
his dash, and his luck were to save him, as by
fire, again and again. He was beloved by
his troops. Wherever he sent them, he was
ready to go himself. He shirked nothing,
and was whole-hearted in everything. Like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
the Russian soldier, Skobeleff, he was sublime
on the field of battle, and led his men in person.
With a kindly word, “Come, comrades,
follow me!” he could lead them into
the jaws of hell. With a plea like this,
“Comrades, I gave my word to be there; you
won’t make me break it!”—he could inspire
them to superhuman efforts, to drag the heavy
guns through the mud, and thus reach his
ally in time to save.</p>

<p>Heading a cavalry charge at Ligny, his
horse was shot under him, and the French
passed over him twice—once in advancing,
once in retreating—and the darkness was his
friend each time. Dragged by one of his
officers from under his horse, he was borne off
the field bruised, almost unconscious. In two
days, he is leading charges again. Too generous
to suspect an ally, he stands and fights
at Ligny on Wellington’s promise of support,
and when the support doesn’t come he still
does not suspect his ally of calculating selfishness.
His staff <em>does</em>. Hence it was that his
staff opposed him when he wished to yield
to Wellington’s plea for help, on the night of
the 17th. Long did Gneisenau resist
Blücher, contending that Wellington meant
to leave them in the lurch again. But at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
length the chief of staff consented that the
promise of relief be sent, and old Blücher was
happy. The promise was sent, and Wellington
<em>knew</em> it would be kept! Hence he fought
at Waterloo, with the knowledge that his task
consisted in holding out until the Prussians
could arrive.</p>

<p>The heroic struggle of Blücher to make
progress over the terrible roads, his enormous
energy, his magnificent devotion to the common
cause, his unselfish renunciation of credit
for the victory which was due to him more
than to Wellington, raise him to the pinnacle
of military glory. No student of this last
campaign of Napoleon can fail to reach the
conclusion that while Wellington was delaying
at Brussels, sending out orders not suited
to the condition of things at the front, and
taking his supper at Lady Richmond’s ball,
it was Blücher who was where he should have
been, and doing what he should have done.
But for the skilful retreat of Thielman, followed
by the bold concentration at Ligny and
the stubborn fight there, the French would
have gone into Brussels without firing a shot.</p>

<p>On the night of the 18th, Blücher followed
the pursuit as far as Genappe, where his
strength gave out. He went into the inn to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
go to bed, but before undressing, wrote his
wife:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the 16th I was compelled to withdraw
before superior forces, but on the 18th, in concert
with my friend Wellington, I have annihilated
the army of Napoleon.”</p>
</div>

<p>To a friend he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The finest of battles has been fought, the
most brilliant of victories won. I think that
Bonaparte’s history is ended. I cannot write
any more, for I am trembling in every limb.
The strain was too great.”</p>
</div>

<p>Blücher was seventy-three years old.
Napoleon and Wellington were nearly the
same age, both being born in 1769, and therefore
forty-seven years old.</p>

<p>Blücher was notoriously a hard drinker,
and had been so all his life. Both Napoleon
and Wellington were extremely sober men;
yet Blücher had shown more energy than the
other two together.</p>

<h3>NEY</h3>

<p>A mournful interest must always attach to
Ney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>As Napoleon said, his “Bravest of the
Brave” was no longer the same man. First
of all, in this campaign he was not handled
right. The Emperor should have employed
him sooner, or not at all: should have
trusted him further, or not at all. The manner
in which he was caught up at the last
moment and cast into the activities of the
campaign was most unwise.</p>

<p>In spite of the bad behavior of Ney in
1814, the troops were glad to see him in their
midst. Their nickname for him was “Red-head,”
and they called him this to each other
as they saw him join the Emperor at Beaumont.
“All will go well now—Red-head
is with us!”</p>

<p>But Ney was not at himself. There is no
other phrase that will do,—all of us know
what it means. When the orator whom we
<em>know</em> to be a heaven-born orator fails to move
us, we say, “He is not at himself.” When
the brilliant writer is dull; when the expert
mechanic is awkward; when the painter’s
brush misses the conception, when the sculptor’s
chisel cannot follow his thoughts, when
the master musician makes discord, we have
nothing better to say than “He is not at himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p>So it was with Marshal Ney. Advancing
upon Quatre Bras, he stopped, afraid of going
too far. When had Ney been timid before?</p>

<p>Realizing at length what was expected of
him, he fought furiously to take the position
which would have been his without a fight
had he simply not stopped in sudden fear
the evening before. Then, having been the
Ney of old on the 16th, he became timid
again on the morning of the 17th, and let
Wellington draw off without any attempt to
molest the retreat. Why no reports to the
Emperor all that day of the 16th? Why
none on the night of the 16th? Very near
to the treason for which officers are shot, was
this sullen silence. He was not at himself.
Then at Waterloo, the Ney of old comes out
again. He is not only bold, but rash. He is
possessed of a devil of fight. He is no longer
a general: he is just a reckless brigadier.
Headlong charges, blind rushes, frantic management
which is calamitous mismanagement;
premature sacrifice of cavalry, false formation
of columns of attack, then wild rage and
despair, and prayers for death! The soldier
never lived that fought harder and longer
than Ney at Waterloo. As darkness closed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
down, and the torrents of retreat ran past
him, this heroic and ill-starred soldier, his
face black with powder smoke, his uniform
in tatters, the blood oozing from bruises, a
broken sword in his hand, cried out, “Come
and see how a Marshal of France dies!”
But alas, the flood of disaster bore him away,
and this leonine Frenchman was left to make
a target for French muskets. All of Ney’s
horses had been killed under him, and he
owed his life—a bad debt, as it turned out—to
a faithful subaltern.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The restored Bourbons were determined
to put Ney to death. Instead of leaving his
fate in the hands of his old companions in
arms, as his lawyer wanted him to do, Ney
foolishly gave preference to a trial by the
civilians of the Chamber of Peers. This tribunal
condemned him, and he was shot. So
says History.</p>

<p>But Tradition is persistent in claiming that
the execution was a fake: that blank cartridges
were fired, that Ney fell unhurt, and
that his body was spirited away, and that he
was shipped off to America, and that he lived
in North Carolina, a school-teacher, until he
died a natural death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>Many a time I have ridiculed this tradition,
and marshaled in convincing array the
evidence against it. I must confess, however,
that a statement in the book of Sir William
Fraser, called “Wellington’s Words,”
startled me. He expresses a doubt as to the
genuineness of the execution of Marshal Ney,
<em>and Sir William was close to Wellington</em>.
Indeed, the account which Sir William gives
of the alleged execution is somewhat suggestive
of a mock execution.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning, and the Garden
of the Luxembourg was filled with children,
attended by their nurses, taking the
morning air, amid the trees and birds and
flowers. A closed carriage drove up to the
gate and four men, leaving the carriage, entered
the garden. One was Marshal Ney,
the others an officer and two sergeants. The
officer placed Ney against the wall, called
the picket guarding the gate, gave the word
“Fire!” and Ney fell on his face. The body
was immediately put into the carriage and
driven off. The nurses and the children had
not realized what was happening. Says Sir
William Fraser (who had this account from
Quentin Dick, an eye-witness), “I confess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
to have got a lingering doubt whether Ney
was shot to death.”</p>

<p>But Sir William himself supplies a bit of
evidence which resettles my own conviction
that Ney <em>was</em> shot to death. The second
Duke of Wellington was invited by Queen
Victoria to meet at Windsor Castle the Emperor
of the French. In the train of Louis
Napoleon, the French Emperor, was the son
of Marshal Ney. The Emperor said, “I
must introduce two great names,” leading
the Duke of Wellington to the Prince of
Moscowa. The Duke made a low bow: the
Prince did not return it. He remembered
the murder of his father, and knew that the
first Duke of Wellington should have prevented
it. In answer to the Emperor’s
whispered remonstrance, Ney’s son firmly declared
that he did not wish to make the acquaintance
of Wellington’s son. To my
mind this is conclusive. Had Ney’s life been
saved by the first Duke of Wellington, as
Sir William Fraser broadly hints, two things
are certain: (1) Ney’s son would have known
it, and (2) Ney’s family would have gratefully
honored Wellington’s memory, instead
of detesting it.</p>

<p>No: the lion-like Ney did not teach school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
in North Carolina; he died a dog’s death
in the garden of the Luxembourg. A victim
to the cold perfidy of Wellington, a bloody
sacrifice to the vindictive ferocity of Bourbon
royalism, the magnificent French soldier was
shot to death by Frenchmen—shot like a
dog, and fell on his battle-worn face dead,
dead, while the song of birds was in the trees,
and the innocent laughter of children rang in
his ears. Well did he say when they were
reading his death-sentence, in which all of his
high-sounding titles were being enumerated,
“Just Michel Ney—soon to be a handful of
dust.”</p>

<p>Full of error, yet full of virtue: pure gold
at one crisis, mere dross at another; superbly
great on some occasions, and pitiably weak
on others; true as steel one day, unsubstantial
as water the next; dangerous to the
enemy on some fields, fatally dangerous to
Napoleon in the last campaign, the truth remains
that this strenuous soldier had been
fighting the battles of France all his life, had
never failed her at any trial, had never joined
her enemies, and must have died of heart-break
as well as bullet-wound when he heard
a French officer give the word, and saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
French soldiers raise their guns to shoot him
down.</p>

<p>Honor to the son of Ney who refused to
take the hand of Wellington’s son, although
a Queen was the hostess, and an Emperor
whispered a remonstrance!</p>
